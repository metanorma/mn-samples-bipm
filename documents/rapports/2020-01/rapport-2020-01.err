To this end, the software package OzonE was used. This software, which is documented in a publication <eref type="inline" bibitemid="bremser" citeas="[6]"/>, is an extension of the previously used software B_Least, recommended by the ISO standard 6143:2001 <eref type="inline" bibitemid="iso6143-2" citeas="[7]"/>. OzonE allows users to account for correlations between measurements performed with the same instrument at different ozone amount-of-substance fractions.</p>
