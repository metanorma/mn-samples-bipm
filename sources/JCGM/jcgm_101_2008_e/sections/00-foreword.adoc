In 1997 a Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/jc/jcgm/[(JCGM)], chaired by the Director of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), was created by the seven international organizations that had originally in 1993 prepared the "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement" (GUM) and the "International vocabulary of basic and general terms in metrology" (VIM). The JCGM assumed responsibility for these two documents from the ISO Technical Advisory Group 4 (TAG4).

The Joint Committee is formed by the http://www.bipm.org/[BIPM] with the International Electrotechnical Commission http://www.iec.ch/[(IEC)], the Interna-tional Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine http://www.ifcc.org/[(IFCC)], the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation http://www.ilac.org/[(ILAC)], the International Organization for Standardization http://www.iso.org/[(ISO)], the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry http://www.iupac.org/[(IUPAC)], the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics http://www.iupap.org/[(IUPAP)], and the International Organization of Legal Metrology http://www.oiml.org/[(OIML)].

JCGM has two Working Groups. Working Group 1, "Expression of uncertainty in measurement", has the task to promote the use of the GUM and to prepare Supplements and other documents for its broad application. Working Group 2, "Working Group on International vocabulary of basic and general terms in metrology (VIM)", has the task to revise and promote the use of the VIM.

Supplements such as this one are intended to give added value to the GUM by providing guidance on aspects of uncertainty evaluation that are not explicitly treated in the GUM. The guidance will, however, be as consistent as possible with the general probabilistic basis of the GUM.

The present Supplement 1 to the GUM has been prepared by Working Group 1 of the JCGM, and has benefited from detailed reviews undertaken by member organizations of the JCGM and National Metrology Institutes.
