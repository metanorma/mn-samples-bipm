In 1997 a Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/jc/jcgm/[(JCGM)], chaired by the Director of the BIPM, was created by the seven international organizations that had originally in 1993 prepared the 'Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement' (GUM) and the 'International vocabulary of metrology { basic and general concepts and associated terms' (VIM). The JCGM assumed responsibility for these two documents from the ISO Technical Advisory Group 4 (TAG4).

The Joint Committee is formed by the http://www.bipm.org/[BIPM] with the International Electrotechnical Commission http://www.iec.ch/[(IEC)], the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine http://www.ifcc.org/[(IFCC)], the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation http://www.ilac.org/[(ILAC)], the International Organization for Standardization http://www.iso.org/[(ISO)], the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry http://www.iupac.org/[(IUPAC)], the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics http://www.iupap.org/[(IUPAP)],  and the International Organization of Legal Metrology http://www.oiml.org/[(OIML)].

JCGM has two Working Groups. Working Group 1, 'Expression of uncertainty in measurement', has the task to promote the use of the GUM and to prepare Supplements and other documents for its broad application. Working Group 2, 'Working Group on International vocabulary of basic and general terms in metrology (VIM)', has the task to revise and promote the use of the VIM. For further information on the activity of the JCGM, see http://www.bipm.org/[www.bipm.org.]

The present document has been prepared by Working Group 1 of the JCGM, and has bene ted from detailed reviews undertaken by member organizations of the JCGM.

This document constitutes one part in a series of JCGM documents under the generic heading _Evaluation of measurement data_. The parts in the series are

* JCGM 100:2008. Evaluation of measurement data -- Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM) (see clause 2),
* JCGM 101:2008. Evaluation of measurement data -- Supplement 1 to the "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement" -- Propagation of distributions using a Monte Carlo method (see clause 2),
* JCGM 102. Evaluation of measurement data -- Supplement 2 to the "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement" -- Models with any number of output quantities,
* JCGM 103. Evaluation of measurement data -- Supplement 3 to the "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement" -- Modelling,
* JCGM 104. Evaluation of measurement data -- An introduction to the "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement" and related documents [this document],
