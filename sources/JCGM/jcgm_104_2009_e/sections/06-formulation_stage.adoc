== The formulation stage: developing a measurement model

[[scls_6-1]]
=== {blank}

The formulation stage of uncertainty evaluation involves developing a measurement model, incorporating corrections and other effects as necessary. In some fields of measurement, this stage can be very difficult. It also involves using available knowledge to characterize the input quantities in the model by probability distributions. JCGM 103 <<bipm_supp3>> provides guidance on developing and working with a measurement model. The assignment of probability distributions to the input quantities in a measurement model is considered in JCGM 101 <<JCGM1012008,clause=6>> and JCGM 102 <<bipm_supp2>>.

A measurement model relating the input quantities to the output quantity is initially developed. There might be more than one output quantity (see <<scls_6-5>>). The model is formed on theoretical or empirical grounds or both, and generally depends on the metrology discipline, electrical, dimensional, thermal, mass, etc. The model is then augmented by terms constituting further input quantities, describing effects that influence the measurement. JCGM 103 <<bipm_supp3>> provides guidance on handling these additional effects, which may be categorized into random and systematic effects.

JCGM 103 considers broader classes of measurement model than does the GUM, categorizing the model according to whether

. [[item_6-3-a]]the quantities involved are real or complex,
. [[item_6-3-b]]the measurement model takes the general form <<eq2,(2)>> or can be expressed as a measurement function <<eq1,(1)>>, and
. [[item_6-3-c]]there is a single output quantity or more than one output quantity (see <<scls_6-5>>).

In category <<item_6-3-a>>, complex quantities occur especially in electrical metrology, and also in acoustical and optical metrology. In category <<item_6-3-b>>, for a measurement function the output quantity is expressed directly as a formula involving the input quantities, and for a general measurement model an equation is solved for the output quantity in terms of the input quantities (see <<scls_6-5>>).

Examples from a range of metrology disciplines illustrate various aspects of JCGM 103. Guidance on numerical analysis aspects that arise in treating these examples is given. Guidance also includes the use of changes of variables so that all or some of the resulting quantities are uncorrelated or only weakly correlated.

The GUM and <<JCGM1012008>> concentrate on measurement models in the form of measurement functions having a single output quantity stem:[ii(Y)]. Many measurement problems arise, however, for which there is more than one output quantity, depending on a common set of input quantities. These output quantities are denoted by stem:[ii(Y)_1,..., ii(Y)_m]. Instances include <<item_6-3-a>> an output quantity that is complex, and represented in terms of its real and imaginary components (or magnitude and phase), <<item_6-3-b>> quantities representing the parameters of a calibration function, and <<item_6-3-c>> quantities describing the geometry of the surface of an artefact. The GUM does not directly address such models, although examples are given concerning simultaneous resistance and reactance measurement <<JCGM1002008,clause=(GUM) H.2>> and thermometer calibration <<JCGM1002008,clause=(GUM) H.3>>.

The formulation phase of uncertainty evaluation for the case of more than one measurand is consistent with that for a measurement model with a single measurand: it comprises developing a model and assigning probability distributions to the input quantities based on available knowledge. As for a measurement model with a single output quantity, there is an estimate of each input quantity and a standard uncertainty associated with that estimate (and possibly covariances associated with pairs of estimates). Furthermore, since in general each output quantity depends on all the input quantities, in addition to determining estimates of these output quantities and the standard uncertainties associated with these estimates, it is required to evaluate the covariances associated with all pairs of these estimates.

The counterpart of the measurement function <<eq1,(1)>> for a number m of output quantities is

in which there are m functions stem:[f_1,..., f_m.] <<fig5>> illustrates such a measurement function.

_Multistage measurement models_, where the output quantities from previous stages become the input quantities to subsequent stages, are also treated in JCGM 103. A common example of a multistage measurement model relates to the construction and use of a calibration function <<JCGM2002008,clause=(VIM) 2.39>> (see <<fig6>>):

. Given quantity values provided by measurement standards, and corresponding indication values provided by a measuring system, determine estimates of the parameters of the calibration function. The standard uncertainties associated with the measured quantity values and the indication values give rise to standard uncertainties associated with these estimates and in general with covariances associated with all pairs of these estimates;

. Given a further indication value, evaluate the calibration function to provide the corresponding measured quantity value. This step involves the inverse of the calibration function. The standard uncertainties and covariances associated with the estimates of the parameters of the calibration function, together with the standard uncertainty associated with the further indication value, give rise to a standard uncertainty associated with this measured quantity value.
