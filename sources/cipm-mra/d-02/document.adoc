== Background

After the CIPM MRA was signed in 1999, it was considered that in order to draw the attention of their customers, and other interested parties, to the recognition by all other signatories of the CIPM MRA of the validity of the calibration and measurement certificates issued by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) participating of the CIPM MRA, the certificates may include a "CIPM MRA Logo" together with a "CIPM MRA statement" referred to the CIPM MRA.

This document provides guidelines for the use of the "CIPM MRA Logo" and the "CIPM MRA statement".

== General considerations

Use of the "CIPM MRA Logo" and the "CIPM MRA statement" is optional.

The "CIPM MRA Logo" and the "CIPM MRA statement" can only be displayed on the certificates of those calibration and measurement services that are covered by a Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) published in the  https://kcdb.bipm.org/AppendixC/default.asp[Appendix C] section of the BIPM key comparison database (https://kcdb.bipm.org[KCDB]) available on the BIPM website footnote:[A CMC is deemed to cover services that meet all of the following criteria:
* Use the same instrument type/measurement method as that identified in the CMC, noting that more than one instrument type/measurement method can be listed in one CMC,
* Fall within the range covered by the CMC,
* Have measurement uncertainty no less than the uncertainty quoted in the CMC, with appropriate treatment, documented in the quality system, for any methods/instruments listed that are derived, i.e. involve further steps in the metrological traceability chain.]. In cases where a small percentage of the items reported in the certificates of the calibration and measurement services are not covered by CMCs published in the Appendix C section of the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB), then those items shall be clearly noted as not being supported by the CIPM MRA.

In context of the CIPM MRA calibration and measurement services are considered as:

* the calibrations delivered by participating NMIs/DIs in accordance with the requirements of the ISO/IEC 17025;
* the certified reference materials (CRMs) that are produced by participating NMIs/DIs according to ISO 17034. footnote:[In March 2018, The Joint Committee of the Regional Metrology Organizations and the BIPM (JCRB) Resolution 39/3 determined that the Regional Metrology Organizations shall ensure that all NMI’s and DI’s declaring CMC’s within the CIPM MRA shall have demonstrated conformance of their quality management systems to the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 and ISO 17034:2016 (in so much as they are applicable to the CMCs of the NMI or DI), no later than three years after the publication date of the standards. Until such time the current versions of the documents are applicable.]

=== For the calibration certificates

The "CIPM MRA Logo" and "CIPM MRA statement" can be affixed to calibration certificates, and if so, must be used together. Requirements on use of the logo and statement are described in <<guidelines>>.

If the calibration certificates include statements of compliance or verification against an identified metrological specification or clauses thereof (as allowed by Section 5.10.4 of the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 footnote:[In ISO/IEC 17025:2017 the relevant clauses are 7.8.3.1 (b), 7.8.4.1 (e), and 7.8.6.2 (a-c).]), the "CIPM MRA Logo" and "CIPM MRA statement" may still be affixed to the certificate. However, this does not imply endorsement of the claim of compliance or verification. Therefore, in these cases the statement described in <<guidelines>> shall be amended by the adding of the following words:

[quote]
____
_"...The "CIPM MRA Logo" and this statement attest only to the measurement component of the certificate"_
____

However, to avoid confusion, where a statement of compliance or verification is required, the recommended practice is to issue both a calibration certificate (which, provided the requirements in this document are met, may bear the "CIPM MRA Logo" together with the "CIPM MRA statement"), and a separate statement of compliance or verification, without the "CIPM MRA Logo" or the "CIPM MRA statement".

=== For the certified reference materials (CRMs) certificates

The "CIPM MRA Logo" and "CIPM MRA statement" can be affixed to the certificates for CRMs, and if appropriate on the CRM packages. Requirements on use of the logo and statement are described in <<guidelines>>. The statement shall be amended by the adding of the following words:

[quote]
____
_"...The "CIPM MRA Logo" and this statement attest only to the measurement(s) applied for determining the certified values on the certificate"_
____

=== Use of the "CIPM MRA Logo"

Description of the logo. The logo for the CIPM MRA is:

[%unnumbered]
image::img01.png[]

This logo, designated as "CIPM MRA Logo", is the exclusive property of the BIPM.

The "CIPM MRA Logo" consists of the image of the Pavillon de Breteuil designed in blue with a yellow arc around it [as represented in the logo of the BIPM which is protected by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) under the terms of Article 6ter of the _Convention de Paris pour la protection de la propriété industrielle du 20 mars 1883_ (révisée)], and the acronym "CIPM MRA" below, which represents the _Arrangement for Mutual Recognition of national measurement standards and for calibration and measurement certificates issued by national metrology institutes drawn up by the International Committee for Weights and Measures._ This acronym is made of the acronym "CIPM", which designates the International Committee for Weights and Measures, and the term "CIPM MRA", which is the acronym commonly used for Mutual Recognition Arrangement.

==== Location and size

. Location. It is recommended that the "CIPM MRA Logo" appears on the same page in the certificate of the calibration and measurement services where the logo used to identify the NMI/DI also appears. The inclusion of any additional logos representing other organizations remains at the discretion of the NMI or DI, but no implication or endorsement of these other organizations by the CIPM MRA shall be made or implied.
. Size. It is recommended that the size of the "CIPM MRA Logo" be no larger than the size of the logo used to identify the NMI.

=== Use of the "CIPM MRA statement"

The following "CIPM MRA statement" shall also be included on the calibration certificates together with the logo.

[quote]
____
_This certificate is consistent with the capabilities that are included in Appendix C of the CIPM MRA drawn up by the CIPM. Under the CIPM MRA, all participating institutes recognize the validity of each other’s calibration and measurement certificates for the quantities, ranges and measurement uncertainties specified in Appendix C (for details see http://www.bipm.org)._
____

NOTE: In making a French version it became clear that in French it is necessary to be more explicit than in English. The following is the French text that has also been agreed:

[quote]
____
_Ce certificat est en accord avec les aptitudes en matière de mesures et d’étalonnages (CMCs) figurant dans l’annexe C de l’arrangement de reconnaissance mutuelle (CIPM MRA) rédigé par le Comité international des poids et mesures (CIPM). D’après les termes du CIPM MRA, tous les laboratoires participants reconnaissent réciproquement la validité des certificats d’étalonnage et de mesurage pour les grandeurs, domaines et incertitudes de mesure mentionnés dans l’annexe C (pour plus de détails, voir (http://www.bipm.org)._
____

The corresponding longer English version is the following:

[quote]
____
_This certificate is consistent with the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) that are included in Appendix C of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA) drawn up by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM). Under the CIPM MRA, all participating institutes recognize the validity of each other’s calibration and measurement certificates for the quantities, ranges and measurement uncertainties specified in Appendix C (for details see http://www.bipm.org)._
