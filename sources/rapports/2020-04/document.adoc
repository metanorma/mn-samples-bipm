.Abstract

A comparison of the ozone reference standards of the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has been performed. Both institutes maintain Standard Reference Photometers (SRPs), developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as their reference standards. The instruments were compared over a nominal ozone amount-of-substance fraction range of stem:[0 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] to stem:[500 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] and the results showed good agreement.

== Introduction

A comparison of the ozone reference standards of the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was performed. Both institutes maintain Standard Reference Photometers (SRPs), developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as their reference standards. This comparison was performed following the protocol established for the key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, described briefly in <<protocol>>. A description of the standards is given in <<standards>> of this report, together with their uncertainty budgets. The results of the comparison are given in <<results_uncertainties>>, <<differences>> and <<analysis>>.

== Terms and definitions

stem:[x_("nom")]:: nominal ozone amount-of-substance fraction in dry air furnished by the ozone generator
stem:[x_("A,i")]:: stem:[i]th measurement of the nominal value stem:[x_("nom")] by the photometer stem:["A"]
stem:[bar x_"A"]:: the mean of stem:[ii(N)] measurements of the nominal value stem:[x_("nom")] measured by the photometer stem:["A" : bar x_"A" = 1/ii(N) sum_(i=1)^ii(N) x_("A,i")]
stem:[s_"A"]:: standard deviation of stem:[ii(N)] measurements of the nominal value stem:[x_("nom")] measured by the photometer stem:["A" : s_"A"^2 = 1/(ii(N)-1) sum_(i=1)^ii(N)(x_("A,i")-bar x_"A")^2]

* The result of the linear regression fit performed between two sets of data measured by the photometers stem:["A"] and stem:["B"] during a comparison is written: stem:[x_"A" =  a_("A,B")x_"B" + b_("A,B")]. With this notation, the photometer stem:["A"] is compared against the photometer stem:["B"]. stem:[a_("A,B")] is dimensionless and stem:[b_("A,B")] is expressed in units of stem:["unitsml(nmol/mol)"].

== Measurement schedule

Measurements reported in this report were performed from 3 to 6 February 2020 at the BIPM.

[[protocol]]
== Measurement protocol

This comparison was performed following the protocol established for the key comparison BIPM.QM-K1. As ECCC is not a Designated Institute under the CIPM MRA, the results of this comparison cannot be included in BIPM.QM-K1, but are published in this BIPM report.

The protocol is summarized in this section. The complete version can be downloaded from the BIPM website (http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/BIPM.QM-K1_protocol.pdf).

This comparison was performed following protocol A, corresponding to a direct comparison between the ECCC national standard SRP12 and the common reference standard BIPM-SRP27 maintained at the BIPM. A comparison between two (or more) ozone photometers consists of producing ozone-air mixtures at different amount-of-substance fractions over the required range, and measuring these with the photometers.

=== Ozone generation

The same source of purified air is used for all the ozone photometers being compared. This air is used to provide reference air as well as the ozone-air mixture to each ozone photometer. Ambient air is used as the source for reference air. The air is compressed with an oil-free compressor, dried and scrubbed with a commercial purification system so that the amount-of-substance fraction of ozone and nitrogen oxides remaining in the air is below detectable limits. The relative humidity of the reference air is monitored and the amount-of-substance fraction of water in air is typically found to be less than stem:[3 "unitsml(umol/mol)"]. The amount-of-substance fraction of volatile organic hydrocarbons in the reference air was measured (November 2002), with no amount-of-substance fraction of any detected component exceeding stem:[1 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"].

A common dual external manifold in Pyrex is used to furnish the necessary flows of reference air and ozone-air mixtures to the ozone photometers. The two columns of this manifold are vented to atmospheric pressure.

=== Comparison procedure

Prior to the comparison, all the instruments were switched on and allowed to stabilize for at least 8 hours. The pressure and temperature measurement systems of the instruments were checked at this time. If any adjustments were required, these were noted. For this comparison, no adjustments were necessary.

One comparison run includes ten different amount-of-substance fractions distributed over the range, together with the measurement of reference air at the beginning and end of each run. The nominal amount-of-substance fractions were measured in a sequence imposed by the protocol (0, 220, 80, 420, 120, 320, 30, 370, 170, 500, 270, and 0) stem:["unitsml(nmol/mol)"]. Each of these points is an average of ten single measurements.

For each nominal value of the ozone amount-of-substance fraction xnom furnished by the ozone generator, the standard deviation stem:[s_("SRP27")] of the set of ten consecutive measurements stem:[x_("SRP27")],i recorded by BIPM-SRP27 was calculated. The measurement results were considered valid if stem:[s_("SRP27")] was less than stem:[1 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"], which ensures that the photometers were measuring a stable ozone concentration. If not, another series of ten consecutive measurements was performed.

=== Comparison repeatability

The comparison procedure was repeated continuously to evaluate its repeatability. The participant and the BIPM decided when both instruments were stable enough to start recording a set of measurement results to be considered as the official comparison results.

=== SRP27 stability check

A second ozone reference standard, BIPM-SRP28, was included in the comparison to verify its agreement with BIPM-SRP27 and thus follow its stability over the period of the ongoing key comparison.

== Reporting measurement results

The participant and the BIPM staff reported the measurement results on the result form BIPM.QM-K1-R1, provided by the BIPM, and which is available on the BIPM website. It includes details of the comparison conditions, measurement results and associated uncertainties, as well as the standard deviation for each series of ten ozone amount-of-substance fractions measured by the participant’s standard and the common reference standard. The completed form, BIPM.QM-K1-R1-ECCC-20 is given in the <<appendix1>>.

== Post-comparison calculation

All calculations were performed by the BIPM using the information on form BIPM.QM-K1-R1. It includes the difference from the reference value at two nominal ozone amount-of-substance fractions, which are considered as degrees of equivalence for the key comparison BIPM.QM-K1. For information, the difference from the reference value at all nominal ozone amount-of-substance fractions are reported in the same form, as well as the linear relationship between the participant’s standard and the common reference standard.

[[standards]]
== Measurement standards

The instruments maintained by the BIPM and the ECCC are Standard Reference Photometers (SRP) built by the NIST. More details on the instrument’s operating principle and its capabilities can be found in <<paur>>. The following section describes the measurement principle and the uncertainty budgets.

=== Measurement equation of a NIST SRP

The measurement of the ozone amount-of-substance fraction by an SRP is based on the absorption of radiation at stem:[253.7 "unitsml(nm)"] by ozonized air in the gas cells of the instrument. One particular feature of the instrument design is the use of two gas cells to overcome the instability of the light source. The measurement equation is derived from the Beer-Lambert and ideal gas laws. The number concentration (stem:[ii(C)]) of ozone is calculated from:

[[eq1]]
[stem]
++++
ii(C) = (-1)/(2 ii(sigma) ii(L)_("opt")) ii(T)/ii(T)_("std") ii(P)_("std")/ii(P) "ln"(ii(D))
++++

where

stem:[ii(sigma)]:: is the absorption cross-section of ozone at stem:[253.7 "unitsml(nm)"] under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, stem:[1.1476 xx 10^(−17) "unitsml(cm^2)""/molecule"] <<ambient>>.
stem:[ii(L)_("opt")]:: is the mean optical path length of the two cells;
stem:[ii(T)]:: is the measured temperature of the cells;
stem:[ii(T)_("std")]:: is the standard temperature (stem:[273.15 "unitsml(K)"]);
stem:[ii(P)]:: is the measured pressure of the cells;
stem:[ii(P)_("std")]:: is the standard pressure (stem:[101.325 "unitsml(kPa)"]);
stem:[ii(D)]:: is the product of transmittances of two cells, with the transmittance (stem:[ii(T)_"r"]) of one cell defined as

[[eq2]]
[stem]
++++
ii(T)_"r" = ii(I)_("ozone")/ii(I)_("air")
++++

where

stem:[ii(I)_("ozone")]:: is the UV radiation intensity measured from the cell when containing ozonized air, and
stem:[ii(I)_(air)]:: is the UV radiation intensity measured from the cell when containing pure air (also called reference or zero air).

The ideal gas law equation <<eq1>> can be rewritten in order to express the measurement results as an amount-of-substance fraction (stem:[x]) of ozone in air:

[[eq3]]
[stem]
++++
x = (-1)/(2 ii(sigma) ii(L)_("opt")) ii(T)/ii(P) ii(R)/(ii(N)_"A") "ln"(ii(D))
++++

where

stem:[ii(N)_"A"]:: is the Avogadro constant, stem:[6.022142 xx 10^(23) "unitsml(mol^-1)"], and
stem:[ii(R)]:: is the gas constant, stem:[8.314472 "unitsml(J*mol^-1*K^-1)"]

The formulation implemented in the SRP software is:

[[eq4]]
[stem]
++++
x = (-1)/(2 ii(alpha)_x ii(L)_("opt")] ii(T)/ii(T)_("std") ii(P)_("std")/ii(P) "ln"(ii(D))
++++

where

stem:[ii(alpha)_x]:: is the linear absorption coefficient at standard conditions, expressed in stem:[ "unitsml(cm^-1)"], linked to the absorption cross-section with the relation:

[[eq5]]
[stem]
++++
ii(alpha)_x = ii(sigma) ii(N)_"A"/ii(R) ii(P)_("std")/ii(T)_("std")
++++

=== Absorption cross-section for ozone

The linear absorption coefficient under standard conditions αxused within the SRP software algorithm is stem:[308.32 "unitsml(cm^-1)"]. This corresponds to a value for the absorption cross section stem:[ii(sigma)] of stem:[1.1476 xx 10^(-17) "unitsml(cm^2)""/molecule"], rather than the more often quoted stem:[1.147 xx 10^(-17) "unitsml(cm^2)""/molecule"]. In the comparison of two SRP instruments, the absorption cross-section can be considered to have a conventional value and its uncertainty can be set to zero. However, in the comparison of different methods or when considering the complete uncertainty budget of the method, the uncertainty of the absorption cross-section should be taken into account. A consensus value of 2.12 % at a 95 % level of confidence for the uncertainty of the absorption cross-section has been proposed by the BIPM and the NIST in a recent publication <<viallon3>>.

=== Condition of the BIPM SRPs

Compared to the original design described in <<paur>>, SRP27 and SRP28 have been modified to take into account two biases revealed by the study conducted by the BIPM and the NIST <<viallon3>>. In 2009, an "SRP upgrade kit" was installed in the instruments, as described in the report <<viallon4>>.

=== Uncertainty budget of the common reference BIPM-SRP27

The uncertainty budget for the ozone amount-of-substance fraction in dry air (stem:[x]) measured by the instruments BIPM-SRP27 and BIPM-SRP28 in the nominal range stem:[0 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] to stem:[500 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] is given in <<table1>>.

|===

As explained in the protocol of the comparison, following this budget the standard uncertainty associated with the ozone amount-of-substance fraction measurement with the BIPM SRPs can be expressed as a numerical equation (numerical values expressed as stem:["unitsml(nmol/mol)"]):

[[eq6]]
[stem]
++++
u(x) = sqrt((0.28)^2+(2.92+10^(-3)x)^2)
++++


=== Covariance terms for the common reference BIPM-SRP27

Correlations between the results of two measurements performed at two different ozone amount-of-substance fractions with BIPM-SRP27 were taken into account using the software OzonE. Details about the analysis of the covariance can be found in the protocol. The following expression was applied:

[[eq7]]
[stem]
++++
u(x_i,x_j) = x_i*x_j*u_b^2
++++

where:

[[eq8]]
[stem]
++++
u_b^2 = (u^2(ii(T)))/(ii(T)^2) + (u^2(ii(P)))/(ii(P)^2) + (u^2(ii(L)_("opt")))/(ii(L)_("opt")^2)
++++

The value of stem:[u_b] is given by the expression of the measurement uncertainty: stem:[u_b = 2.92 xx 10^(−3)].

=== Condition of the SRP12

The ECCC SRP12 was built by the NIST in 1988. It was modified in 2013 to install the same "SRP upgrade kit" as in the two BIPM SRPs.

=== Uncertainty budget of the SRP12

The uncertainty budget for the ozone amount-of-substance fraction in dry air stem:[x] measured by the ECCC standard SRP12 in the nominal range stem:[0 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] to stem:[500 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] is given in <<table2>>.

Following this budget, the standard uncertainty associated with the ozone amount-of-substance fraction measurement with the SRP12 can be expressed as a numerical equation (numerical values expressed as stem:["unitsml(nmol/mol)"]):

[[eq9]]
[stem]
++++
u(x) = sqrt((0.28)^2 + (2.92 * 10^(-3) x)^2)
++++

No covariance term for the SRP12 was included in the calculations.

[[results_uncertainties]]
== Measurement results and uncertainties

Details of the measurement results, the measurement uncertainties and the standard deviations at each nominal ozone amount-of-substance fraction are given in the form BIPM.QM-K1-R1-ECCC-20 (<<appendix1>>).

[[differences]]
== Differences from the reference values

For the key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, differences from the reference values were calculated at the twelve nominal ozone amount-of-substance fractions measured, but are only shown in this report at two particular values: stem:[80 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] and stem:[420 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"]. These values correspond to points 3 and 4 recorded in each comparison. The ozone amount-of-substance fractions measured by the ozone standards can differ from the nominal values because an ozone generator has limited reproducibility. However, as stated in the protocol, the value measured by the common reference SRP27 was expected to be within stem:[pm 15 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] of the nominal value. Hence, it is meaningful to compare the degree of equivalence calculated for all the participants at the same nominal value.

=== Definition

The difference from the reference value of the participant stem:[i] at a nominal value stem:[x_("nom")] is defined as:

[[eq10]]
[stem]
++++
ii(D)_i = x_i - x_("SRP27")
++++

where stem:[x_i] and stem:[x_("SRP27")] are the measurement result of the participant stem:[i] and of SRP27 at the nominal value stem:[x_("nom")].

Its associated standard uncertainty is:

[[eq11]]
[stem]
++++
u(ii(D)_i) = sqrt(u_i^2 + u_("SRP27")^2)
++++

where stem:[u_i] and stem:[u_("SRP27")] are the measurement uncertainties of the participant stem:[i] and of SRP27 respectively.

=== Values

The differences from the reference values and their uncertainties calculated in the form BIPM.QM-K1-R1-ECCC-20 are reported in <<table3>> below. Corresponding graphs of equivalence are given in <<fig1>>. The expanded uncertainties are calculated with a coverage factor stem:[k = 2].

The differences between the ECCC standard and the common reference standard BIPM SRP27 indicate agreement between both standards.

[[analysis]]
== Analysis of the measurement results by generalized least-square regression

The relationship between two ozone photometers was evaluated with a generalized least-square regression fit performed on the two sets of measured ozone amount-of-substance fractions, taking into account standard measurement uncertainties. To this end, the software package OzonE was used. This software, which is documented in a publication <<bremser>>, is an extension of the previously used software B_Least, recommended by the ISO standard 6143:2001 <<iso6143>>. OzonE allows users to account for correlations between measurements performed with the same instrument at different ozone amount-of-substance fractions.

In a direct comparison, a linear relationship between the ozone amount-of-substance fractions measured by SRP__n__ and SRP27 is obtained:

[[eq12]]
[stem]
++++
x_("SRP"n) = a_0 + a_1x_("SRP27")
++++

The associated uncertainties on the slope stem:[u(a_1)] and the intercept stem:[u(a_0)] are given by OzonE, as well as the covariance between them and the usual statistical parameters to validate the fitting function.

=== Least-square regression results

The relationship between SRP12 and SRP27 is:

[[eq13]]
[stem]
++++
x_("SRP12") = 1.0014x_("SRP27") + 0.24
++++

The standard uncertainties on the parameters of the regression are stem:[u(a_1) = 0.0033] for the slope and stem:[u(a_0) = 0.22 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] for the intercept. The covariance between the two parameters is stem:["cov"(a_0, a_1) = −2.02 xx 10^(−4) "unitsml(nmol/mol)"].

The least-square regression statistical parameters confirm the appropriate choice of a linear relation, with a sum of the squared deviations (SSD) of 0.14 and a goodness of fit (GoF) equal to 0.14.

To assess the agreement of the standards from <<eq10>>, the difference between the calculated slope value and unity, and the intercept value and zero, together with their measurement uncertainties need to be considered. In the comparison, the value of the intercept is consistent with an intercept of zero, considering the uncertainty in the value of this parameter; i.e stem:[abs(a_0)<2u(a_0)], and the value of the slope is consistent with a slope of 1; i.e. stem:[abs(1-a_1) < 2u(a_1)].

== History of comparisons between BIPM SRP27, SRP28 and ECCC SRP12

Although ECCC SRP12 was one of the first SRPs built by the NIST, this is the first comparison ever performed between this instrument and the BIPM SRPs. The history of comparisons between the two BIPM SRPs can be found in previous reports of the comparison BIPM.QM-K1 (https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/comparison?id=1428).

== Conclusion

A comparison was performed between the ozone reference standards of the ECCC and of the BIPM. The instruments were compared over a nominal ozone amount-of-substance fraction range of stem:[0 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"] to stem:[500 "unitsml(nmol/mol)"]. Results of this comparison indicated good agreement between both standards.
