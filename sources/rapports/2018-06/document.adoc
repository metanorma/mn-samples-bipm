.Abstract

Information is presented on the experimental conditions used in the x- and gamma-radiation beams at the BIPM for comparisons of national primary standards and calibrations of national secondary standards in terms of air kerma and absorbed dose to water, together with the uncertainties involved in the determination of these dosimetric quantities.

== Introduction

For each signatory of the Metre Convention and for a given type of measurement, the BIPM works with the National Metrology Institute (NMI) or a laboratory designated nationally for the purpose. For those laboratories that hold national primary standards, the BIPM compares these standards against the BIPM reference standards, either directly using the primary standards in the BIPM reference beams or indirectly through the calibration of transfer instruments by both the BIPM and the NMI. For those that do not hold primary standards, the BIPM calibrates secondary standards that are then normally used as national reference instruments. For this reason, the chambers should be instruments of good quality; in particular with respect to leakage current and both short- and long-term stability.

Comparisons, characterizations and calibrations of ionization chambers are performed at the BIPM in terms of:

* air kerma in the low- (including mammography) and medium-energy x-ray ranges and in ^60^Co gamma radiation;
* absorbed dose to water in medium-energy x-ray beams and in ^60^Co gamma radiation;

The present report documents the conditions of measurement at the BIPM, the values for the physical constants and correction factors, and the estimated uncertainties in the determination of the primary quantities and of calibration coefficients.

== General remarks

The reference plane is specified in terms of a distance from the radiation source or, in the case of low-energy x-rays, from the beam exit window. The reference point is the intersection of the beam axis with the reference plane.

For chamber types other than parallel plate, the chamber is positioned with its axis in the reference plane and with the stated point of measurement of the chamber at the reference point. For measurements in gamma radiation, the chamber is used with the build-up cap provided. The orientation of the chamber is such that the number, text or line inscribed on the stem faces the radiation source, unless a different orientation is indicated. Parallel-plate chambers are calibrated with the front surface of the chamber casing in the reference plane, unless a different surface is indicated on the chamber, and with the entrance window centred on the beam axis.

All chambers are irradiated for at least thirty minutes, with the appropriate polarizing potential applied to the outer electrode (wall or window), before any measurements are made. If the NMI applies a potential of a given polarity to the collecting electrode, the BIPM will apply the same potential with opposite polarity to the outer electrode.

The leakage current is normally measured before and after each set of measurements and a correction is applied, based on the mean value. A chamber for which the relative leakage current is high, and in particular for which the leakage is also variable, is unsuitable for use as a transfer instrument and might also be considered unsuitable for calibration. In the latter case, a study note is issued.

The irradiation facilities at the BIPM are temperature controlled (close to stem:[20 "unitsml(degC)"]) at the level of around stem:[100 "unitsml(mK)"]. For air-kerma measurements in ^60^Co, an additional passive enclosure is used to ensure temperature stability below stem:[50 "unitsml(mK)"]. The BIPM reference conditions for air temperature, pressure and relative humidity are stem:[ii(T)_0 = 293.15 "unitsml(K)"], stem:[ii(P)_0 = 101.325 "unitsml(kPa)"] and 50 %, respectively. As the relative humidity is controlled within the range 40 % to 55 %, no humidity correction is applied.

_Calibration of national standards_: No correction is applied for lack of saturation; the air-kerma rate or absorbed-dose-to-water rate is stated in the certificate. For thimble chamber types calibrated in gamma radiation and in airkerma for medium-energy x-rays, the radial non-uniformity correction for the BIPM beams is small and is stated in the certificate, although no correction factor is applied. For waterproof thimble chamber types calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water in medium-energy x-rays, the correction factor at the reference depth will be similar at both laboratories and again no correction factor is applied. In low-energy x-rays, chambers of larger dimensions may be calibrated and the radial uniformity of the beam shows more variation from one laboratory to another. For these reasons, the appropriate correction factor is always applied.

_Comparisons of national standards_: This depends to some extent on the practice at the NMI and no general statement can be made; the measuring conditions adopted are clearly stated in the comparison report.

== Comparison and calibration in terms of air kerma (x-rays, ^60^Co)

The primary standard, transfer chamber or national reference standard is operated in air at the stated reference distance. The ionization current stem:[ii(I)] is determined under the BIPM reference conditions of air temperature, pressure and humidity. The value of stem:[ii(I)] is given by

[[eq1]]
[stem]
++++
ii(I) = ii(I)_("exp") (ii(T)/(ii(T)_0)) ((ii(P)_0)/ii(P))
++++

where stem:[ii(I)_("exp")] is the ionization current measured at temperature stem:[ii(T)] (expressed in K) and pressure stem:[ii(P)] (expressed in stem:["unitsml(kPa)"]).

For a transfer chamber or national reference standard, the calibration coefficient stem:[ii(N)_K] is defined by the relation

[[eq2]]
[stem]
++++
ii(N)_K = dot(ii(K))_("BIPM")//ii(I),
++++

where stem:[dot(ii(K))_("BIPM")] is the air-kerma rate at the reference point, measured with the BIPM standard.

Details of the conditions of measurement at the BIPM and the uncertainties in the determination of stem:[dot(ii(K))_("BIPM")] are given in <<table1>> to <<table6>> for x-rays and in <<table7>> and <<table9>> for ^60^Co. In these tables, the relative standard uncertainties estimated by statistical methods (Type A) are denoted by stem:[s_("i")] and those estimated by other means (Type B) are denoted by stem:[u_("i")].

== Comparison and calibration in terms of absorbed dose to water (x-rays, ^60^Co)

_^60^Co gamma radiation_

When a primary standard is compared directly, the measuring conditions are stated clearly in the comparison report. For indirect comparisons and calibrations, the transfer chamber or national reference standard is placed in its waterproof sleeve (unless calibration of a waterproof chamber without a sleeve is requested) and positioned in the BIPM cubic water phantom of side length stem:[30 "unitsml(cm)"]. Its axis is placed in the reference plane, at the reference depth of stem:[5 "unitsml(g*cm^-2)"] in water. This depth includes the window of the phantom (PMMA, stem:[0.476 "unitsml(g*cm^-2)"]) and is corrected for the change in water density with temperature. As well as correctly orienting the chamber, a reference mark on the sleeve (if used) is rotated so as to point towards the radiation source, unless a different orientation is indicated.

The calibration coefficient stem:[ii(N)_(ii(D),w)] is determined using the relation

[[eq3]]
[stem]
++++
ii(N)_(ii(D),w) = dot(ii(D))_w//(ii(I)_w k_("win"))
++++

where:

stem:[dot(ii(D))_w]:: is the absorbed dose rate to water at the reference point, measured using the BIPM standard at a depth of stem:[5 "unitsml(g*cm^-2)"] in water;
stem:[ii(I)_w]:: is the ionization current measured using the chamber under the BIPM reference conditions of air temperature, pressure and humidity;
stem:[k_("win") = 0.9997]:: is a correction factor applied to stem:[ii(I)_w] for the non-equivalence with water of the PMMA window of the phantom (required because a similar factor is applied to the BIPM standard).

The conditions of measurement at the BIPM are given in <<table7>>. The physical constants and correction factors used in the ionometric determination of the absorbed dose rate to water at stem:[5 "unitsml(g*cm^(-2))"] are given in <<table9>> along with their estimated relative uncertainties.

_Medium-energy x-ray beams_

Only waterproof thimble chamber types are accepted and are measured without a waterproof sleeve. For indirect comparisons and calibrations, the transfer chamber or national reference standard is positioned in the BIPM cubic water phantom of side length stem:[20 "unitsml(cm)"]. Its axis is placed in the reference plane, at the reference depth of stem:[2 "unitsml(g*cm^-2)"] in water. This depth includes the window of the phantom (PMMA, stem:[0.200 "unitsml(g*cm^-2)"]). Because of the shallow depth, no correction is required for the change in water density with temperature.

The calibration coefficient stem:[ii(N)_(ii(D),w)] is determined using the relation

[[eq4]]
[stem]
++++
ii(N)_(ii(D),w) = dot(ii(D))_w//ii(I)_w,
++++

where:

stem:[dot(ii(D))_w]:: is the absorbed dose rate to water at the reference point at a depth of stem:[2 "unitsml(g*cm^-2)"] in the water phantom, determined by the BIPM standard;
stem:[ii(I)_w]:: is the ionization current measured using the chamber under the BIPM reference conditions of air temperature, pressure and humidity.

At the BIPM, the absorbed dose to water is derived from the air-kerma determination. The conditions of measurement are given in <<table4>>. The physical constants and correction factors used in the ionometric determination of air kerma and the factor for the conversion to absorbed dose to water are given in <<table5>> and their estimated relative uncertainties are given in <<table6>>.

== Use of calibration coefficients

A transfer chamber or national reference standard calibrated in the BIPM beam can be used in another beam, taking the calibration coefficients stem:[ii(N)_K] or stem:[ii(N)_(D,w)] to determine stem:[ii(K)] or stem:[ii(D)_w] in that beam, subject to certain provisions as listed below:

. The humidity conditions must not differ significantly from those of the calibration at the BIPM. If the relative humidity is outside the range 30 % to 70 %, the recommendations of ICRU Report 90 (ICRU 2016) should be used.
. The conditions of measurement must not differ significantly from those of the calibration at the BIPM. Otherwise, additional corrections may be necessary as described by Boutillon _et al_ (1993) and Boutillon (1996). Particular attention should be paid to:

** the radiation quality, particularly in the x-ray range;
** the distance from the source;
** the dimensions of the radiation field, in particular with regard to the radiation scattered by the stem and the support for calibration in terms of air kerma;
** the intensity of the ionization current, which can produce a change in the ion recombination;
** the radial non-uniformity of the beam over the cross-section of the chamber.

== Comparison and calibration uncertainties

The uncertainties associated with dosimetry measurements made at the BIPM are analysed in accordance with the _Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement_ (JCGM 2008). The uncertainty budgets for the dosimetry standards are given in <<table3>>, <<table6>>, <<table8>> and <<table9>>. For comparisons, the BIPM standard uncertainties are combined with those associated with the primary or transfer chamber, taking correlation into account, to give the combined standard uncertainty of the comparison results. The detailed uncertainty budgets are given in the comparison report. For the calibration of national reference standards, the BIPM standard uncertainties are combined with the uncertainties associated with the chamber under calibration to give the combined standard uncertainty of the calibration coefficient. This value is given in the calibration certificate.

It is emphasized that the uncertainty associated with BIPM calibrations is a combined _standard_ uncertainty without the application of a coverage factor stem:[k]. This long-standing practice of not applying a coverage factor is maintained to facilitate the combination of the BIPM and NMI uncertainties and thus simplify the subsequent dissemination of the standard to the customers of the NMI.

The BIPM dosimetry measurements fulfil the criteria of Annex G.6.6 of JCGM (2008). In particular, for the purpose of calculating the expanded uncertainty for their end result at a specified level of confidence, an NMI can assume that the effective number of degrees of freedom for a BIPM calibration is sufficient to be able to use a coverage factor stem:[k = 2] for a level of confidence of approximately 95 %. Any exceptions are noted in the calibration certificate.
