== Scope

This document has been prepared to provide guidance for the value assignment of the mass fraction of zearalenone (ZEN) present in a purified solid ZEN material intended for use as Primary Reference Material.

The information summarized in the document was obtained as part of the BIPM Metrology for Safe Food and Feed Programme for Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer on the production and characterization of reference materials for mycotoxin analysis.

== Introduction

In collaboration with the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) and the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA), the BIPM initiated in 2016 a Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer program for Metrology for Safe Food and Feed in Developing Economies. <<cbkt>> This project is designed to allow NMIs to work together to strengthen the worldwide mycotoxin metrology infrastructure; provide knowledge transfer to scientists developing capabilities in this area and to enable NMIs in developing regions to provide calibrants, matrix reference materials and proficiency test samples that support testing activities and laboratory services for mycotoxin analysis within their countries.

As for all other areas of organic analysis primary reference materials consisting of well characterized, high purity compounds are required for each analyte subject to investigation. These materials are the source of higher-order metrological traceability for the assigned values of derived calibration solutions, reference materials, proficiency test samples and ultimately the results of routine analysis. Access to pure organic compounds and calibration solutions prepared from these materials is an essential element in the measurement infrastructure supporting the delivery of reliable, comparable results. In the case of mycotoxins purity analysis of source materials involves additional challenges linked to the limited amount of available material and its potential toxicity.

Zearalenone, a fungal secondary metabolite produced by _Fusarium spp_, is a frequent contaminant of food and animal feed, in particular of maize but is also found in barley, oats and wheat. <<betina>>, <<lorenz>> It is a non-steroid estrogenic compound which can cause changes in reproductive organs and fertility loss and has been shown to have several other toxic effects. <<zinedine>> The ability to undertake robust and reliable analysis for zearalenone and related compounds is required for health and food safety and for trade in primary produce for countries which produce or consume large quantities of corn grains and wheat. <<jrc>>

An essential requirement of this project was to obtain and characterize a primary reference material for zearalenone that could be used subsequently to establish a calibration heirarchy to underpin the metrological traceability of results linked through calibration to this material. <<bievre>> This guideline summarizes characterization and purity assignment studies to assess identity and purity of a Primary Reference Material <<iso17511>> for zearalenone used to deliver the BIPM MMCBKT program and is intended to be of use to other metrology institutes and reference measurement service providers needing to characterize their own source material for zearalenone analysis. Particular reliance was placed on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies both to confirm the qualitative identity of the main component of the material and to assign the mass fraction content of zearalenone it contained.

Due to the relatively complex structure of zearalenone, the assignment by qNMR only provides in the first instance an estimate of the total zearalenone and related structure impurity content. This initial value needed to be corrected for the relevant related structure impurity content as assigned separately by LC-MS/MS and LC-DAD methods to give the final value for the absolute zearalenone content of the material. Additional analyses for the assessment of other potential impurities were undertaken to support and confirm the value assigned through combination of the qNMR and LC data.

== Nomenclature and Ring numbering

Throughout this report the nomenclature and abbreviations proposed by Metzler <<metzler>> for the specification of zearalenone and related compounds are used. Zearalenone is abbreviated as ZEN, while noting that in other literature ZON or ZEA are also used for the same structure. The abbreviations for the related zearalenols which retain the alkene bond in the macrocyclic ring are based on ZEL and those for the zearalanols, in which the ring alkene bond is no longer present, are based on ZAL.

For the numbering of the carbon skeleton the IUPAC system which assigns the C-atoms of ZEN from 1–18 is used. This supercedes systems based on use of the numbers 1–6 for the aromatic ring and 1’–12’ for the aliphatic carbons of the macrocyclic ring. The structure of ZEN with the current and historical ring numbering schemes are shown respectively in <<fig1>> and <<fig2>>.

The full structures and abbreviations for ZEN, its related metabolite family and impurities identified in the course of this work program are shown in <<chemical_structures>>.

== Properties of Zearalenone

=== Hazard Identification

The substance poses high potential risks for human health if handled inappropriately. It is toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed. Exposure to ZEN may cause cancer.

==== Residual solvent content by NMR

In the ^1^H NMR spectrum of the BIPM material it was possible to detect impurity peaks not present in the solvent blank originating from residual solvents: a singlet at 5.3 ppm from dichloromethane, a singlet at 3.33 ppm from methanol and a quartet at 3.5 ppm which could be either ethanol or diethyl ether. The latter is the more likely according to previously reported chemical shifts. <<gottlieb>>

To obtain an accurate quantification of these small signals a spectrum was acquired using 512 transients, a relaxation delay of 60 s between scans and applying the parameters optimized for quantitative analysis of ZEN (see <<table5>> in <<qnmr>>). From this spectrum, the mass fractions of the residual solvents were calculated from the ratio of the signal integral to that of reference peaks in the ZEN spectrum. Two possible scenarios for the origin of the quartet at 3.5 ppm (either ethanol or diethyl ether) were considered. Two different ZEN peaks were used as reference values and the average values were considered as fit-for-purpose estimates of the mass fractions of the residual solvent content. To investigate the possibility that the quantification of these residual solvent peaks was influenced by contributions from ^13^C satellite peaks of adjacent ZEN peaks an acquisition using ^13^C-decoupling and otherwise the same parameters was also performed and the results compared.

The data from the two experiments (with and without ^13^C-decoupling) with calculation relative to two different ZEN peaks provided a combined result derived from the four calculated values for the levels of each residual solvent. The measurement uncertainty for this result includes contributions from the uncertainty in the molar masses of both ZEN and the solvents in addition to the pooled variation between the different measurement procedures (2 peaks, 2 acquisitions). The difference in the combined residual solvent content due uncertainty in whether ethanol or diethyl ether is present is negligible, but in order to maintain metrological traceability, an additional uncertainty component was added to take this into account. On the basis of the observed chemical shift the more likely identity is diethyl ether. If desired the identities of the residual solvents could be independently established and quantified using headspace GC-MS based technique. The results for residual solvent content assigned by the relative NMR response and their associated measurement uncertainties are summarized in <<table4>>. Representative spectra showing each solvent signal relative to the adjacent ZEN peaks are given in <<residual_solvent>>.

== Purity assignment of Zearalenone

=== Introduction

This section of the Guideline describes the approach developed during the BIPM MMCBKT program for the purity assignment of the ZEN source material. It is based on a quantitative NMR (qNMR) measurement <<holzgrabe>>, <<bharti>> to quantify the total ZEN and related structure impurity content with correction of the raw qNMR result for the ZEN-related impurity content quantified by LC methods.

The qualitative identity of the ZEN material was established and an estimate of residual solvent impurity content in the material was obtained using the combination of 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques described in <<qualitative_nmr>> above. This identification was supported by determination of the mass spectrometric and UV-Vis spectrophotometric properties of the material. The assignment of the ZEN content by qNMR through the selection of quantification peak(s), the identification of an appropriate internal standard and the choice of a deuterated solvent is described in <<properties>>.

The development and application of methods for the identification and quantification of the ZEN-related impurity content of the material by LC-MS/MS and LC-DAD is described in <<structure>>. These results were used to correct the "raw" qNMR value for ZEN and ZEN-related impurity content in the source material to give the final assignment of the actual ZEN content of the material.

Supporting analyses undertaken to detect other impurity classes are summarized in <<qualitative_nmr>> and the selection and combination of the data to give the final purity assignment of the material is described in <<uv_vis>>.

Another approach for the purity assignment of ZEN has been reported through a combination of data obtained by NMR, LC-MS, UV spectrophotometry and DSC. <<krska>>

DISCLAIMER: Commercial NMR and LC instruments, software and materials are identified in this document in order to describe some procedures. This does not imply a recommendation or endorsement by the BIPM nor does it imply than any of the instruments, equipment and materials identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

==== Materials

*Chemicals*

[align=left]
* Zearalenone (ZEN); BIPM Reference OGO.178a +
Supplier: First Standard, Product No. 1ST7204, Lot ALT601341
* Zearalanone (ZAN); BIPM Reference OGO.182a +
Supplier: First Standard, Product No. 1ST7203, Lot LZ106742
* Dimethylterephthalate (DMTP); BIPM Reference OGE.022b was used as the qNMR internal standard <<bipm2019-1>>. The mass fraction content of DMTP in the material was assigned as stem:[999.3 +- 0.8" mg/g "(k = 2)] by qNMR at the BIPM.

*NMR Solvents*:

* Acetone-stem:[d_6]; BIPM Reference OGS.029
* Dimethylsulfoxide-stem:[d_6] (DMSO-stem:[d_6]); BIPM Reference OGS.027c
* Deuterated chloroform (CDCl~3~); BIPM Reference OGS.026b

Deuterated solvents were purchased from a commercial supplier and used without further treatment. NMR tubes were HG-Type: high grade class, 8 inch, 5 mm diameter rated for use with 600 MHz spectrometers fitted with PE caps.

==== Sample preparation

Gravimetric operations were performed using a Mettler Toledo XP2U ultramicrobalance. Prior to all weighing operations the repeatability of the balance was assessed for suitability to the preparation of qNMR samples by repeat mass determinations of an empty weigh boat. The general recommendations of Yamazaki et al <<yamazaki>> for qNMR sample preparation were used.

Four separate samples were prepared. The individual sample sizes were in the range 4 mg- 10 mg for the ZEN material and 2 mg to 4.5 mg for the internal standard DMTP. Each sample was separately weighed into an aluminium weighing boat and then to avoid contact of the solvent with the metal boat, the contents of both were carefully transferred into a common glass vial and each emptied boat was reweighed. The amount of ZEN and DMTP transferred into the glass vial was determined by difference and this value was used for subsequent qNMR calculations. 1 mL of deuterated solvent was added to the vial and the sample solution was mixed in a vortex shaker and checked visually for completeness of dissolution. Approximately stem:[800" "mu"L"] of this solution was transferred into an NMR tube (HG-Type: high grade class, 8 inch, 5 mm o.d., with PE cap) using a glass pasteur pipette.

==== Choice of solvent and quantification signals

Because of the complexity of the ZEN proton spectrum in the upfield section of the spectrum (stem:[delta < 5" ppm"]) the potential quantification peaks are limited to those occurring at chemical shift between 5 ppm and 7 ppm, corresponding to the aromatic (H-13 and H-15), olefinic (H-11 and H-12) and lactone bridge (H-3) protons.

CDCl~3~, DMSO-stem:[d_6] and acetone-stem:[d_6] were investigated as possible solvents. The hydrogen peak from the phenol at position 14 overlays the signal for H-11 at 5.7 ppm, rendering this peak unsuitable for quantification. The signals due to the two aromatic hydrogens centered at 6.4 ppm were associated in this material with small impurities at the baseline of the peak which were considered too close to be subtracted. The most attractive signals for quantification purposes were that at 7.0 ppm corresponding to the H-12 proton and that at 5.0 ppm due to H-3. The peak at 5.0 ppm is a complex multiplet with lower intensity compared to the peak at 7.0 ppm resulting in a lower relative signal to noise ratio. In addition all impurities in the material from either the ZEN or ZAN family will have a signal at a similar chemical shift. It was known from the LC characterization of the material (see <<structure>>) that ZAN was one of the major impurities in the material.

The peak at 7.0 ppm was judged as more suitable for quantification as it would not include any contribution from the ZAN impurity or ZAN-related impurities. However in CDCl~3~ this peak is overlaid by the residual chloroform ^13^C satellite. In DMSO-stem:[d_6] the chemical shift of the peak moves to 6.6 ppm. It is now in too close proximity to the signals for the aromatic hydrogen to be used for qNMR. However for acetone-stem:[d_6] the H-12 signal chemical shift remains at 7.0 ppm and the residual solvent peak is well separated from the quantification region.

An unanticipated advantage was also discovered in the use of acetone-stem:[d_6] as solvent. It was observed that a significant curve occurred in the baseline of the spectra of ZEN in solution in CDCl~3~ or DMSO-stem:[d_6] which was not in evidence with spectra in acetone-stem:[d_6]. This may simply result from a contribution to the baseline from a broad acidic hydrogen signal in the aprotic solvents that is exchanged out in solution in acetone-stem:[d_6] due to the unavoidable presence therein of a small amount of water associated with the solvent. Whatever the source of the interference a bias to lower values was observed when qNMR was carried out on ZEN in solution CDCl~3~ and DMSO-stem:[d_6] compared with the value obtained in solution in acetone-stem:[d_6]. It is strongly advised to ONLY use acetone-stem:[d_6] for qNMR studies of ZEN materials.

Spectra illustrating the contrast between the baseline of the NMR spectrum of ZEN in acetone-stem:[d_6] and CDCl~3~ are reproduced in <<baseline_contrast>>.

DMTP was selected as the internal standard selected for the qNMR study. <<bipm2019-1>> This material is readily soluble and stable in both non-polar and semi-polar solvents such as acetone-stem:[d_6]. The signal due to the four equivalent aromatic protons in DMTP which occur as a sharp singlet at 8.0 ppm was used for quantification. The integration ratio was calculated against both the multiplet ZEN H-12 signal at 7.0 ppm and the H-3 signal at 5.0 ppm. The initial qNMR result for the quantification against the signal at 5.0 ppm must be corrected for contributions from all three impurities identified by LC-methods (see <<structure>>) whereas the result using the signal at 7.0 ppm need only be corrected for contributions from 6-dehydro ZEN and _cis_-ZEN impurities.

==== NMR acquisition parameters

A JEOL ECS-400 spectrometer operating at 9.4 T (400 MHz for proton) equipped with a direct type automatic tuning (Royal) probe operating using the Delta software was used for all NMR data acquisition.

The general recommendations for optimizing spectrometer performance, determining the relevant NMR experiment parameters and undertaking a qNMR experiment as described in the BIPM Internal Standard Reference Data report for the use of DMTP for qNMR measurements <<bipm2019-1>> were followed. The final qNMR acquisition parameters are summarized in <<table5>>.

==== qNMR signal integration

A baseline correction window of eighty times the FWHM was applied to each integrated signal. The integration range start and end points were placed fifty Hz beyond the visible edge of each signal. Results from four independent sample mixtures each measured four times were obtained.

==== Value assignment and measurement uncertainty

Results from four independent sample mixtures each measured four times on the day of preparation were obtained with quantification using the one proton signal due for H-12 in ZEN at stem:[delta = 7.0]. The measurement uncertainty budget is reproduced below in <<table6>>. The integral ratio is the overall mean of the four replicate values obtained for each of the four samples, normalized for the different sample sizes used in their preparation. The standard uncertainty of the normalized ratio is the standard deviation of the mean based on the use of four independent samples. The relative contribution of each component to the uncertainty of the result for this material is displayed in <<fig6>>. The mass fraction content of "ZEN" in the material from this analysis, quantified against the 7.0 ppm NMR peak in "ZEN", was stem:[998.0 +- 1.8" mg"*"g"^(-1)], bearing in mind that this estimate includes the contributions from the 6-dehydro ZEN and _cis_-ZEN impurities.

Note in the uncertainty budget that the contribution from the gravimetric operations and the purity of the internal standard are as important to the overall uncertainty of the purity assignment as the contribution due to the repeatability of the integral ratio determination.

The qNMR assignment was repeated using the same set of NMR data obtained on the day of preparation of the sample but with quantification against the one proton signal for H-3 in ZEN at stem:[delta" "5.0]. It was also repeated using the same samples and NMR acquisition and processing parameters three and seven days after the original sample preparation in order to evaluate the stability of the ZEN in solution. The qNMR assignments were obtained for each data set with quantification against both the stem:[delta" "7.0" ppm"] and stem:[delta" "5.0" ppm"] signals.

* Zearalanone (ZAN); BIPM Reference OGO.182a +
Supplier: First Standard, Product No. 1ST7203, Lot LZ106742
* stem:[alpha]-Zearalenol (stem:[alpha]-ZEL), stem:[beta]-Zearalenol (stem:[beta]-ZEL), stem:[alpha]-Zearalanol (stem:[alpha]-ZAL), stem:[beta]-Zearalanol (stem:[beta]-ZAL) were all provided as 100 ppm solutions in acetonitrile by First Standard

==== Standard solutions

Two standard solutions of mass fractions of approximately 200 mg/kg were prepared using the ZEN (OGO.178) and ZAN (OGO.182) materials. Each stock solution consisted of approximately 4.2 mg of material weighed accurately and made up to the mark in a 25 mL flask with acetonitrile to a final weight of approximately 19.4 g. Gravimetric operations were undertaken using a Mettler AX-504 balance. The ambient temperature during gravimetric operations was 22 °C and relative humidity 54 %. For further calculations the mass fraction content of the ZEN and ZAN was based on the purity assigned for these materials at the BIPM by qNMR. For the solutions of stem:[alpha//beta]-ZAL and stem:[alpha//beta]-ZEL the values provided by the supplier were used.

From these six standard solutions a high concentration mixed working solution (HMC) of ZEN, ZAN, stem:[alpha//beta]-ZAL and stem:[alpha//beta]-ZEL was gravimetrically prepared by weighing accurately approximately 72 mg of three stock solutions (ZEN, ZAN, stem:[beta]-ZAL) and 110 mg of the other stock solutions (stem:[alpha]-ZEL, stem:[beta]-ZEL, stem:[alpha]-ZAL) in a 1.5 mL HPLC vial and adding acetonitrile to a final weight of approximately 0.9 g to obtain a mixed working solution. From this high concentration mixed working solution, a middle concentration mixed working solution (MMC) was prepared by accurately weighing approximately 460 mg of the HMC solution in a 1.5 mL HPLC vial and adding water to a final weight of approximately 1 g

A series of five standard dilutions for each of "day 1" and "day 2" measurements were gravimetrically prepared by further dilution of the MMC solution.

==== LC-DAD method development

A Phenomenex Kinetex EVO C-18 100Å column with dimensions stem:[250 xx 4.6" mm"] and stem:[2.6" "mu"m"] particle size was used to separate the ZEN, ZAN and related structure compounds in the ZEN material. According to previous research <<krska>> ZEN is of limited stability in solution in methanol and this solvent should be avoided for use in the mobile phase for chromatographic analysis of ZEN. A method using as mobile phase an acetonitrile/water gradient was optimized to achieve adequate resolution of the six components of the test mixture in the smallest possible runtime.

==== LC-DAD method performance

Method validation consisted of the evaluation of the method limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, sensitivity, repeatability and intermediate precision.

Performance characteristics (limits of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3), limits of quantification (LOQ) (S/N = 6), sensitivity, etc. were calculated corresponding to the 95 % - confidence level (CI) of the y-intercept according to the German standard DIN 32645 for each of ZEN, ZAN, stem:[alpha//beta]-ZAL and stem:[alpha//beta]-ZEL. The characteristics were evaluated from the calibration curves obtained from triplicate determinations of standard solutions.

In total, five mass fraction levels were analysed based on the amount of impurity estimated to be present in the ZEN material. The results for ZEN and ZAN are displayed in <<table8>>.

==== Impurities in ZEN by LC-DAD

Two samples of the ZEN source material OGO.178a were analysed for related impurities using this method. About 4.2 mg of the ZEN material was transferred by aluminium weighing boat into a tared class A 25 mL volumetric, taken up in pure acetonitrile and allowed to stand over night at 4 °C. Aliquots of each solution were transferred into HPLC screw top vials for analysis. The target mass fraction content of ZEN in the solution was aimed to be about stem:[200" "mu"g"*"g"^(-1)] in order to be able to detect low levels of related structure impurities. The mass fraction of each identified impurity was derived by external calibration over an appropriate linear mass fraction range.

For a ZEN sample at a mass fraction of stem:[200" "mu"g"*"g"^(-1)] for the major component, 0.1 % (or stem:[0.2" "mu"g"*"g"^(-1)]) of an impurity corresponds to an absolute mass fraction of stem:[200" ng"*"g"^(-1)]. The absolute LODs corresponding to 3*S/N approach for the absorbance at 274 nm range from stem:[53" ng"*"g"^(-1)] for stem:[alpha]-ZEL to stem:[127" ng g"^(-1)] for ZAN, giving confidence that this method would be able to detect resolved ZEN-related impurities present at relative levels above 0.1 %.

The chromatogram obtained for the ZEN material in solution in acetonitrile at stem:[200" "mu"g"*"g"^(-1)] is shown in <<fig8>>. The upper pane shows the 274 nm response and the lower pane the TIC obtained by a parallel LC-MS/MS analysis of the same solution. Two impurities were detected using the LC-DAD method. The impurity eluting at 28.5 min was identified as ZAN based on its retention time and this assignment was subsequently confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The other impurity corresponded closely but not exactly to the retention time stem:[alpha]-ZEL. Subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis identified this impurity as 6-dehydroZEN.

[[fig8]]
.Chromatogram of LC-DAD (top) and LC-MS/MS (bottom) analysis of a solution of the ZEN OGO.178a source material
image::img09.png[]

No significant amounts of stem:[alpha//beta]-ZAL or stem:[alpha//beta]-ZEL were observed in the ZEN material by LC-DAD and this conclusion was subsequently confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis.

The quantification of the ZAN content in the ZEN material was undertaken using an external calibration curve based on the available ZAN standard. For the 6-dehydro ZEN a calibration curve based on stem:[alpha]-ZEL was used since they had similar retention time and no authentic standard was available for the impurity. The impurity mass fraction values and expanded measurement uncertainties as determined by the LC-DAD method are shown in <<table9>>.

==== LC-MS/MS method development

A method of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was also developed for the simultaneous determination of ZEN, ZAN, stem:[alpha//beta]-ZAL and stem:[alpha//beta]-ZEL in the ZEN material. The same column and gradient method described for the LC-DAD analysis were used as the DAD and MS/MS measurements were undertaken in tandem on column eluant from the same LC system.

The MS parameters in negative electrospray ionization (ESI neg.) mode were optimised by direct infusion into the ionization source of the QTrap of single LC standards of ZEN, ZAN, stem:[alpha//beta]-ZAL and stem:[alpha//beta]-ZEL and the MRM parameters of each compound were optimized. Each measurement using the optimized parameters was undertaken in triplicate. Optimized intensity was obtained at capillary voltage of -4500 V and source temperature of 550 °C. Nitrogen was used as the ion source gas, curtain gas and collision gas. The Gas 1 and Gas 2 of ion source were at 55 psi and 50 psi; the curtain gas (CUR) was set at 15 psi. The Collision Gas (CAD) was set at Mid. <<table10>> lists the results for each compound’s optimization in MRM mode.

The transitions of impurities in the material for which no authentic sample was available (6-dehydroZEN, dihydroxy-6-dehydronsZEN, _cis_-ZEN) were determined by direct observation.

==== LC-MS/MS method performance

Method validation consisted of the evaluation of the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, sensitivity, repeatability and intermediate precision.

Performance characteristics (limits of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3), limits of quantification (LOQ) (S/N = 6), sensitivity, etc. of the method were calculated corresponding to the 95 % - confidence level (CI) of the y-intercept according to the German standard DIN 32645 for ZEN, ZAN, stem:[alpha//beta]-ZAL and stem:[alpha//beta]-ZEL. The characteristics were evaluated from the calibration curves obtained from triplicate determinations of standard solutions.

In total, five mass fraction levels were analysed based on the amount of impurity estimated to be potentially present in the ZEN material. The method performance for ZEN and ZAN is displayed in <<table11>>.

The linearity of the working range was evaluated by constructing calibration curves at five different concentration levels. In order not to reject the linearity hypothesis, a determination coefficient (r^2^) of at least 0.999 was required. Sensitivity was also determined from the calibration curve, being equal to the angular coefficient.

Note that the LOD/LOQ estimates for the LC-MS/MS method shown in <<table11>> are an order of magnitude smaller than those for the LC-DAD analysis of the same samples listed in <<table10>>.

==== Impurities in ZEN by LC-MS/MS

The MS3-IDA-EPI mode of the Qtrap4000 was applied to identify these impurities with a Valco valve function included in the method to cut off the main component from introduction into the ionization chamber.

The HPLC chromatography conditions were listed in the following:

*Column*:: Kinetex C18 ( 2.6 um*150 mm*3.0 mm) OGLC056
*Column temperature*:: 35 °C
*Mobile phase*:: Acetonitrile+MeOH+H~2~O (with 10 mM NH~4~AC) =10+45+45
*Operation mode*:: isocratic
*Flow rate*:: 0.25mL/min
*Injection Mode*:: Standard
*Injection volume*:: stem:[2.0" "mu"L"]
*Duration*:: 30.0 min

A solution of approximately stem:[1.0" mg"*"g"^(-1)] of ZEN was prepared by accurately weighing approximately stem:[7.7" mg"] of material into a stem:[10" mL"] flask and adding methanol to a final weight of approximately stem:[7.85" g"]. The calculated mass fraction of the ZEN material in the solution was stem:[977.9" "mu"g"*"g"^(-1)]. To avoid contamination of the LC-MS/MS instrument by the high content of ZEN component, the LC method was slightly changed. After chromatographic separation the mobile phase was switched to waste during elution of the ZEN component, to cut out this peak from the ionization chamber so as to be able to better detect and analyse the minor impurities present in the material. <<fig10>> shows the TICs of the ZEN solution in the MS3-IDA-EPI mode of the Qtrap4000 in the upper pane with the LC-DAD response at 274 nm in the lower pane. Four impurities, marked as impurity 1, 2, 3 and 4, were observed in the TIC. Two of these corresponded to peaks also seen at 274 nm using the LC-DAD. After comparison with the authentic standard, the impurity 3 was confirmed as ZAN. Impurity 4 has the same precursor ion and fragment ions as ZEN and was identified as _cis_-ZEN. The precursor ions and fragmental ions of the main component (ZEN) and the four impurities are listed in <<table12>>.

Quantitative estimates of the three major impurities present in the ZEN material identified by LC-MS/MS were undertaken. The quantification of the ZAN content was undertaken using an external calibration curve prepared with the ZAN standard. As no authentic standards were available for the other impurities the quantification of 6-DehydroZEN was undertaken using the stem:[alpha]-ZEL calibration curve and for _cis_- ZEN using the ZEN calibration curve. The impurity mass fraction values and corresponding expanded measurement uncertainties are summarised in <<table13>>.

=== Final ZEN Purity assignment

In the case of the OGO.178.a material the initial value of the purity of the uncorrected total "ZEN" content was stem:[998.0 +- 1.8" mg/g"]. This was the mean of sixteen qNMR assignments (four samples each analysed in quadruplicate) using freshly prepared sample quantified against the signal at 7.0 ppm.

The estimates of the impurity components in the material form the LC methods were:

For the final assignment of true ZEN content the initial qNMR value was corrected for 7-dehydroZEN and _cis_-ZEN content only as ZAN does not contribute to the signal at 7.0 ppm. This gave an assigned value of the ZEN content of OGO.178a as stem:[996.7 +- 1.9" mg/g"], or for reporting purposes stem:[997 +- 2" mg/g"]
