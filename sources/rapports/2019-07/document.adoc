== Scope

This document has been prepared to provide guidance on the preparation and value assignment of a calibration solution of aflatoxin B~1~ (AfB~1~) in the mass fraction range of stem:[2-50 "unitsml(mg/kg)"]. The calibration solution is prepared by gravimetric dilution of a gravimetrically prepared stock solution having known AfB~1~ content and it is intended for use as a primary calibrator for AfB~1~ analysis.

The information summarized in the document was obtained as part of the BIPM Metrology for Safe Food and Feed Programme for capacity building and knowledge transfer on the production and characterization of reference materials for mycotoxin analysis.

== Introduction

In collaboration with the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) and the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA), the BIPM initiated in 2016 a Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer program for Metrology for Safe Food and Feed in Developing Economies. <<cbkt>> This project is designed to allow NMIs to work together to strengthen the worldwide mycotoxin metrology infrastructure; provide knowledge transfer to scientists developing capabilities in this area and to enable NMIs in developing regions to provide calibrants, matrix reference materials and proficiency test samples that support testing activities and laboratory services for mycotoxin analysis within their countries.

Calibration solutions prepared from well characterized, high purity compounds are the source of metrological traceability of most routine organic analysis results. The preparation and characterization of these solutions is therefore essential within the measurement infrastructure that supports the delivery of reliable results. It is particularly challenging in the case of the provision of standards to underpin mycotoxin testing in developing economies due to stringent export / import regulations, challenging logistics and high costs.

Aflatoxins are generally produced by fungi of the genus _Aspergillus_ that have access either pre- or post-harvest to grain and nut crops in environmental conditions of relatively high temperatures and humidity. Frequently contaminated food products include dried figs, hazelnuts, groundnuts, chili peppers, pistachio and almond. <<rasff>> Aflatoxin B~1~, among the four major types of aflatoxins, is the most toxic and the most potent carcinogen in humans and animals. Chronic dietary exposure to aflatoxins, mostly occurring in developing countries, results in hepatotoxicity, genotoxicity, immune suppression and malnutrition. <<rasff>> <<williams>> <<wu>>

The present guideline summarizes methods that can be used for the preparation and characterization of AfB~1~ calibration solutions. The method development and validation studies carried out within the BIPM MMCBKT program are the basis for the results and procedures described herein. The document is intended to be of use to other metrology institutes and reference measurement service providers needing to prepare and characterize their own AfB~1~ primary calibrants to use to underpin the metrological traceability of results. Stock and calibration solutions were prepared from an AfB~1~ source material. For the MMCBKT programme that material was value assigned in-house for purity. Generic methods for the characterization of AfB~1~ pure materials are described in a separate purity evaluation guideline (PEG). <<westwood>> The AfB~1~ solutions prepared gravimetrically from the MMCBKT material were value assigned and dispensed in amber glass ampoules. A range of analytical methods were developed to quantify the mass fraction content of AfB~1~ and related structure impurities in solution in order to evaluate the homogeneity and stability of the materials, as well as to verify the gravimetrically assigned AfB~1~ solution mass fraction content value.

== Properties of Aflatoxin B~1~

=== Hazards identification

The substance poses high potential risks for human health if handled inappropriately. It is acutely toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed. Exposure to AfB~1~ may cause cancer and heritable genetic damage.

DISCLAIMER: The safety recommendations given in this section are based on literature reported best practice and are not verified by the BIPM.

==== Protective measures

Avoid breathing of dust, vapours, mist or gas. Wear full-face particulate filtering respirator type N100 (US) or type P3 (EN 143) respirator cartridges when working with the solid material. Wear protective gloves, goggles and clothing. Take special care to avoid skin exposure if handling solutions and work in adequately ventilated areas. Wash hands thoroughly after handling.

== Methods for the characterization of aflatoxin B~1~ solutions

This section of the Guideline describes the methods developed during the BIPM MMCBKT program for the characterization of the aflatoxin B~1~ stock and calibration solutions prepared from the source AfB~1~ material. The methods are the basis for the stability and homogeneity studies and for the analytical confirmation of the AfB~1~ mass fraction value assigned gravimetrically.

DISCLAIMER: Commercial instruments, software and materials are identified in this document in order to describe some procedures. This does not imply a recommendation or endorsement by the BIPM nor does it imply that any of the instruments, equipment and materials identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

=== AfB~1~ and related structure impurities analysis by LC-DAD-MS/MS

A method based on liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and tandem mass spectrometry was developed for the quantification of related structure impurities in the AfB~1~ source material (BIPM ref. OGO.193a). Details on the method development and validation are described in the separate purity evaluation guideline. <<westwood>> Briefly, original standards were purchased for impurities aflatoxin B~2~, B~2a~, Q~1~, P~1~, G~1~, G~2~, M~1~, M~2~ and aflatoxin B~1~ 8,9-dihydrodiol (DIOL) (<<fig2>>). Their purity was assessed by LC-DAD at stem:[223 "unitsml(nm)"] using the main peak area relative to the total integration across the chromatographic separation. The impurity standards were used to optimize the chromatographic elution and the MS/MS detection parameters that are reported below. The method was validated in-house for the performance characteristics of linearity, precision and limits of detection and quantification.

To avoid contamination of the sensitive MS instrument by the high content of the main AfB~1~ compound, the mobile phase was diverted to waste during the elution window of AfB~1~ so it was measured in the DAD detector but it did not reach the MS.

==== DAD detection parameters

The absorption wavelengths used for the detection of the main component AfB~1~ were stem:[362 "unitsml(nm)"] and stem:[263 "unitsml(nm)"] (reference stem:[450 "unitsml(nm)"]).

==== MS/MS detection parameters

The 4000 QTRAP was operated in a negative-positive switching electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. The capillary voltage was set at stem:[5500 "unitsml(V)"] and the source temperature at stem:[600 "unitsml(degC)"] for the positive ESI. For the negative ESI mode, the capillary voltage was stem:[-4500 "unitsml(V)"] and the source temperature stem:[550 "unitsml(degC)"]. Nitrogen was used as the ion source gas, curtain gas and collision gas. The Gas 1 and Gas 2 of the ion source were set at 55 psi and 60 psi, respectively. The curtain gas (CUR) was set at 15 psi. The Collision Gas (CAD) was set at “Mid”. <<table1>> lists the optimized transitions and conditions for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection of AfB~1~ and its most frequent, structurally related impurities depicted in <<fig2>>.

== Characterization summary of the aflatoxin B~1~ stock solution

[[prep_value_assignment]]
=== Preparation and value assignment

The aflatoxin B~1~ stock solution (OGP.030) was prepared gravimetrically by dissolving about stem:[100 "unitsml(mg)"] of AfB~1~ powder material (OGP.193a) in stem:[1 "unitsml(L)"] of acetonitrile. Mettler Toledo balances MX5 and XP~1~0002S were used for the weighing of OGP.193a and the final solution mass, respectively. <<table2>> demonstrates the preparation of the stock solution and the mass fraction assignment, calculated according to <<eq1>>. The purity of OGP.193a was determined in-house by quantitative NMR corrected for related structure impurities, as described in the Aflatoxin B~1~ purity evaluation guideline. <<westwood>>

The 1L flask containing the stock solution was agitated thoroughly and about stem:[50 "unitsml(mL)"] were used to prepare the calibration solution (<<prep_characterization>>). The rest of the stock solution was stored at stem:[4 "unitsml(degC)"] until ampouling, which took place within stem:[24 "unitsml(h)"] of the preparation. The ampouling process was similar to that of the calibration solution and is described in detail in <<prep_ampouling>>.

=== Stability study

The present section provides a summary of the stock solution stability results. A detailed description of the study design and evaluation is given for the characterization of the calibration solution (<<stability_study>>). The detected AfB~1~ related impurities in the stock solution were AfB~2~, AfB~2a~, AfP~1~, AfQ~1~ and DIOL. They were measured in the tested ampoules by LC-MS/MS whereas the main component AfB~1~ was measured by LC-DAD. In addition, all samples were measured by UV spectrophotometry for total aflatoxin content.

Original impurity standards were used for external calibration of the LC-MS/MS method and the calculated mass fractions were normalized to the reference samples (stored at stem:[-20 "unitsml(degC)"]). For the main component AfB~1~, no calibration was performed so absorbance values were directly normalized to the main peak absorbance of the reference samples. Data were evaluated as a function of the storage time at each of the studied temperatures

A summary of the stability results of the stock solution is presented in <<fig4>>. Based on the data, it was concluded that shipping conditions should not exceed stem:[22 "unitsml(degC)"] and one week transport time. Long-term storage is recommended at the reference temperature (stem:[-20 "unitsml(degC)"]) given the instability of AfQ~1~ and DIOL, which albeit present at concentrations close to the limit of detection, were found to increase over time at higher temperatures.

=== Homogeneity study and combined uncertainty

The homogeneity study for the AfB~1~ stock solution is analogous to that of the calibration solution, which is discussed in detail in <<homogeneity_study>>. The present discussion is therefore limited to a summary of the results. AfB~1~ and its impurities in the selected homogeneity samples were measured by LC-DAD and LC-MS/MS, respectively.

Homogeneity evaluation was done by single factor ANOVA, allowing for the separation of the variation associated with the method (stem:[s_"wb"]) from the actual variation between ampoules (stem:[s_"bb"]), which is an estimate of the uncertainty associated to batch heterogeneity. This uncertainty was 0.24 %, 2.62 % and 4.68 % for AfB~1~ and the two major impurities AfB~2~ and B~2a~, respectively (<<table4>>). Other impurities had associated larger uncertainties due to being present at concentrations near the limit of detection of the method.

== Preparation and characterization of the aflatoxin B~1~ calibration solution

[[prep_ampouling]]
=== Preparation and ampouling

The aflatoxin B~1~ calibration solution (BIPM reference: OGP.029) was prepared by gravimetric dilution of stem:[50 "unitsml(mL)"] of the stock solution with acetonitrile to a final volume of stem:[1 "unitsml(L)"]. The solution was stored at stem:[4 "unitsml(degC)"] until ampouling, which took place within stem:[24 "unitsml(h)"] of the preparation. A stem:[500 "unitsml(mL)"] bottle and stem:[1-10 "unitsml(mL)"] bottle-top dispenser (Dispensette, Brand GMBH) were rinsed twice with the calibration solution and a stainless steel flat tip syringe needle was fitted at the outlet of the dispenser to ensure that all solution is discharged at the bottom of the ampoule.

stem:[10 "unitsml(mL)"] glass ampoules were selected for a filling volume of stem:[4 "unitsml(mL)"] to ensure that sufficient head space remains above the liquid and therefore minimize the risk of accidental ignition of the solvent during the sealing process. An Ampoulmatic (Bioscience Inc) system connected to propane and oxygen cylinders was used to ampoule the batch. The flow of both gases was adjusted so as to produce a bright blue flame at the neck of the ampoules.

The ampoules were filled with stem:[4 "unitsml(mL)"] of OGP.029, one at a time, to minimize the impact of evaporation of acetonitrile. A refrigerant (Jelt Refroidisseur 5320) was sprayed onto the lower portion of the ampoule before being placed in the ampouling carousel to further reduce the ignition risk. After flame sealing, ampoules were allowed to cool down at room temperature in an upright position.

To test for possible leaks, ampoules were placed into a vacuum drying oven (Haraeus) in an upright position and vacuum (50 mbar aprox.) was applied for at least 4 hours. The ampoules then remained in the sealed oven overnight, after which they were visually inspected for changes in the solution levels. Leaking ampoules were recorded and discarded while the rest of the batch was stored at stem:[-20 "unitsml(degC)"].

=== Stability study

==== Study design

Short-term stability studies consider the impact of temperature and time to simulate potential transport conditions and/or storage conditions. Any significant influence of light, UV-radiation, moisture, etc. is excluded provided that the storage facilities and transport/packaging conditions are appropriate.

The stability study of OGP.029 followed an isochronous design <<lamberty>> with a reference temperature of stem:[-20 "unitsml(degC)"] and study temperatures of stem:[4 "unitsml(degC)"], stem:[22 "unitsml(degC)"] and stem:[40 "unitsml(degC)"] and storage in the dark. Selected sample units were transferred from study temperatures to the reference temperature every two weeks until the end of the eight-week study.

The sample units were selected using a random stratified sampling scheme from each of the quartiles of the approximately 200-unit batch. The study was composed of three units at the reference temperature and twelve units at each of the study temperatures, requiring 39 samples in total (<<table6>>).

==== Stability study measurements

Two samples of each time point and temperature conditions were measured under repeatability conditions (same day and run) in a randomised manner using the LC-DAD method for AfB~1~ and the LC-MS/MS method for the related structure impurities. Ampoules were vortexed before opening and two aliquots of stem:[0.5 "unitsml(mL)"] were transferred into separate injection vials to have duplicate measurements of each sample (4 measurements for each condition). Representative TIC and DAD chromatograms of OGP.029 samples are shown in <<fig5>>.

The only two structure-related impurities found in OGP.029 above the limit of detection of the LC-MS/MS method were AfB~2~ and AfB~2a~. Four to five standard calibration solutions containing AfB~2~ and AfB~2a~ standards in the ranges stem:[4.3-21.4 "unitsml(ng/g)"] and stem:[9.5-652 "unitsml(ng/g)"], respectively, were prepared to quantify these impurities by external calibration (<<fig6>>). Triplicate injections per standard level were spread over the analytical sequence. For the main component AfB~1~, no calibration was performed but instead the peak areas from the LC-DAD chromatograms were directly evaluated.

==== Stability data evaluation

Calculated mass fraction values of impurities AfB~2~ and AfB~2a~ and peak area values of the main component AfB~1~ were normalized to the average values of the reference samples (stored at stem:[-20 "unitsml(degC)"]) to render results comparable. Statistical outliers were only removed in case of known technical reasons. As a first evaluation step, normalized data were plotted according to the injection sequence to discard any potential analytical drift. The slopes of the fitted regression lines were not significant (t-test) at the 95% confidence level (<<fig7>>).

Data correspond to normalized mass fractions of AfB~2~ (a) and AfB~2a~ (b) impurities and normalized peak areas of the main compound AfB~1~ as detected by LC-DAD at stem:[263 "unitsml(nm)"] (c) and stem:[362 "unitsml(nm)"] (d).
image::img18.png[]

For each temperature, regression lines of the normalized values versus storage time were calculated. The fitted regression model was tested for overall significance (loss/increase due to storage) using an F-test (95% confidence level). The stability results of the main component and the impurities at each of the studied temperatures are shown in <<fig8>>.

Data correspond to normalized mass fractions of AfB~2~ (top) and AfB~2a~ (middle) impurities and normalized peak areas of the main compound AfB~1~ as detected by LC-DAD at stem:[263 "unitsml(nm)"] (bottom). AfB~1~ data acquired at stem:[362 "unitsml(nm)"] were similar to those at stem:[263 "unitsml(nm)"] (not shown). Dotted lines represent stability-associated uncertainty intervals of the normalized values as a function of the storage time. Single lines are fitted where the stability trend was found to be significant at the 95% confidence level.
image::img19.png[]

At stem:[4 "unitsml(degC)"], all studied compounds in OGP.029 were stable for 8 weeks, as evidenced by the absence of a significant trend (F-test, 95% confidence level). At stem:[22 "unitsml(degC)"], a small declining trend was observed for the main component AfB~1~ over the studied period although the changes were considered negligible at 2 weeks. At stem:[40 "unitsml(degC)"], both the main component and the AfB~2a~ impurity degraded significantly over the 8-week period.

In conclusion, the OGP.029 calibration solution can be shipped safely in the dark at stem:[22 "unitsml(degC)"] if the transport time does not exceed 2 weeks. In addition, storage at stem:[4 "unitsml(degC)"] for a period of up to 8 weeks does not result in significant changes in composition.

[[homogeneity_study]]
=== Homogeneity study

==== Study design

Homogeneity between ampoules is evaluated to ensure that the assigned value of the calibration solution is valid for all units of the material, within the stated uncertainty. It is therefore necessary to determine this between-unit variation and incorporate it in a combined uncertainty estimate.

Ten ampoules were selected from the OGP.029 batch following a randomly stratified sampling scheme. They were measured under repeatability conditions using UV-spectrophotometry for total aflatoxin content and LC-DAD-MS/MS for AfB~1~ and the detected structure-related impurities AfB~2~ and AfB~2a~.

==== Homogeneity study measurements

The selected ampoules were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature were vortexed before opening. They were analyzed in a random order to ensure that any trends in the ampouling process could be distinguished from potential trends in the analytical sequence.

Three aliquots per ampoule were measured consecutively by UV-spectrophotometry using the fixed wavelength method at stem:[223], stem:[265] and stem:[360 "unitsml(nm)"]. Triplicate measurements of each aliquot gave rise to a total of 9 measurements per ampoule and wavelength. Another three aliquots (stem:[>500 "unitsml(uL)"]) were transferred into glass injection vials and stored at stem:[-20 "unitsml(degC)"] until LC-DAD-MS/MS analysis.

==== Homogeneity data evaluation

Absorbance and peak area values were normalized with respect to the average result for each of the studied compounds. Statistical outliers were only removed in case of known technical reasons. Linear regression functions were calculated for the normalized values arranged in ampouling and analysis order. The slopes of the lines were tested for significance at a 95 % confidence level to discard the presence of trends. <<fig9>> shows the UV-stem:[360 "unitsml(nm)"] aflatoxin measurements displayed according to the order of analysis and of ampouling. The dispersion of measurement results across the analytical sequence implied no need for trend correction and this variability is encompassed by the uncertainty associated to homogeneity.

Quantification of between-unit heterogeneity was done by analysis of variance (ANOVA), which allows for the separation of the variation between ampoules (stem:[s_"bb"]) from that associated with the method repeatability (stem:[s_"wb"]). These variances are calculated as follows:

[[eq3]]
[stem]
++++
s_("bb")^2 = (MS_("btw")-MS_("with"))/n
++++

[[eq4]]
[stem]
++++
s_(wb)^2 = MS_("with")
++++

where stem:[MS_("btw")] and stem:[MS_("with")] are the mean sums of squares between- and within-units obtained by the ANOVA evaluation and stem:[n] is the number of replicates per ampoule (stem:[n=3]).

The standard deviation between the sample units is used as the estimator for the between-units variability. The measurement variation sets a lower limit to this estimator reflected in stem:[MS_("btw")] being smaller than stem:[MS_("with")]. This does not imply that the material is perfectly homogeneous, but only shows that the study set-up was not adequate to detect evidence of heterogeneity. In this case, the maximum heterogeneity that could be hidden by the intrinsic variability of the method, stem:[u**_"bb"], is calculated according to the equation below: <<linsinger>>

[[eq5]]
[stem]
++++
u_("bb")** = sqrt((MS_w)/n) * root(4)(2/(p(n-1)))
++++

where stem:[p] is the number of measured ampoules (stem:[p=10]) and stem:[n] is the number of measurement replicates per ampoule (stem:[n=3]).

The final uncertainty from homogeneity (stem:[u_"bb"]) is estimated as stem:[s_"bb"] or stem:[u**_"bb"], depending on which of these is larger. This uncertainty is presented in <<table7>> for every measured compound using the LC-DAD-MS/MS method. The F-test at the 95% confidence level did not detect significant differences between ampoules for any of the studied compounds.

The AfB~1~ mass fraction of OGP.029, calculated according to <<eq6>>, was stem:[6.45 "unitsml(ug/g)"]. The associated uncertainty was calculated by considering the input quantities and related uncertainties represented in the Ishikawa diagram of <<fig11>>.

The standard uncertainties of the input quantities of <<fig11>> were combined (<<eq7>>) to produce the uncertainty of the calibration solution mass fraction, stem:[u(w_(cal))] (<<table10>>). The uncertainty of the stock solution already comprises the purity of the source material and the weighing operations, as described in <<prep_value_assignment>>. The evaporation uncertainty, stem:[u(ii(V))], accounts for potential solvent losses during the weighing of the stock solution and of the final solution. The buoyancy mass correction and its uncertainty were calculated as described by Reichmuth et al. <<reichmuth>>

The aflatoxin B~1~ mass fraction value and associated expanded uncertainty (k=2) of the calibration solution batch was stem:[6.454 +- 0.051 "unitsml(ug/g)"].

=== Mass fraction value verification by analytical methods

The AfB~1~ mass fraction value assigned gravimetrically to the calibration solution OGP.029 can be verified by an independent analytical method to gain additional confidence in the certified value. Both the LC-DAD and the UV-spectrophotometry methods described in <<methods>> can be used for this purpose. Ideally, a different AfB~1~ calibrant of certified purity should be used for calibration so that results are completely independent. In the absence of such calibrant, a partially independent calibration solution could be prepared from the same original source material.

<<fig12>> shows the verification of three different AfB~1~ calibration solution batches prepared in accordance with this guideline. The values assigned gravimetrically were compared to the analytical values obtained using the LC-DAD and the UV-spectrophotometry methods calibrated externally with a semi-independent AfB~1~ standard. The agreement between the pairs of methods values is conveniently assessed using the degrees of equivalence (DoE):

[[eq8]]
[stem]
++++
DoE = w(cal)_(meth) - w(cal)_(grav)
++++

where stem:[w(cal)_(meth)] and stem:[w(cal)_(grav)] are the mass fractions calculated using the analytical and the gravimetric methods, respectively.

The standard uncertainties of the gravimetric (including the homogeneity component) and analytical values add in quadrature to yield the combined uncertainty of the DoE value. The expanded uncertainty bars (k=2) crossing zero indicate the agreement of the analytical measurements (LC-DAD or UV-spectrophotometry) with the gravimetrically assigned values at an approximately 95% confidence level.

[[fig12]]
