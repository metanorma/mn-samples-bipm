== A note on recurrences

Algebraic rearrangements are invariably dull to perform. In addition, they require permanent attention if we want to avoid any error that would render the final result useless. Occasionally, one encounters in such calculations a small problem which may be worth a few moments' thought.

Thus, in the lengthy attempt to evaluate parities for observed counts, when the original Poisson process has been distorted by an extendable dead time, a problem was met which involves summing over alternate moments, defined <<bipm92-5>> by

[[eq1]]
[stem]
++++
m_r^(+-) = sum_(k=0)^oo (-1)^k k^r p_k .
++++

If the probabilities stem:[p_k] follow the Poisson law (with mean value stem:[p]), the moment of order stem:[r >= 1] is known <<bipm92-5>> to be

[[eq2]]
[stem]
++++
m_r^(+-) = e^(-2mu) sum_(j=1)^r S(r,j) (-mu)^j ,
++++

where stem:[S] is a Stirling number of the second kind <<riordan>>.

In the problem encountered, the expression to be evaluated is of the form

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
F = sum_(j=0)^(r-1) ((r-1),(j)) m_(j+1)^(+-) ,
++++

which can be rearranged to become

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
F = e^(-2mu) sum_(k=1)^(j+1) (-mu)^k T(r,k) ,
++++

where

[[eq3]]
[stem]
++++
T(r,k) = sum_(j=0)^(r-1) ((r-1),(j)) S(j+1,k)
++++

is now the quantity in which we are interested.

Consider, for the sake of curiosity, both the binomial coefficients and the Stirling
numbers as triangular matrices of infinite order. In a simplified notation, these are

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ul B = [[1,,,,], [1,1,,,], [1,2,1,,], [color(red)(1),color(red)(3),color(red)(3),color(red)(1),], [1,4,6,4,1], [,,...,,]]
++++
stem:[color(red)(r=4)]

and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ul S = [[1,,,,], [1,color(red)(1),,,], [1,color(red)(3),1,,], [1,color(red)(7),6,1,], [1,15,25,10,1], [,,...,,]] ,
++++
stem:[color(red)(k=2)]

where we have put stem:[((0),(0)) = 1] and omitted the Stirling numbers stem:[S(j,0)] as they are not needed in <<eq3>>.

If we choose, for example. the values stem:[r = 4] and stem:[k = 2], the evaluation of stem:[T(4,2)], according to <<eq3>>, involves pairwise multiplication of the terms within rectangles in the above matrices. It is readily seen that this corresponds to a matrix multiplication; hence we can write symbolically

[[eq4]]
[stem]
++++
ul T = ul B xx ul S ,
++++

where stem:[ul T] is now also a matrix.

If we evaluate, for a few arguments, the numerical values of stem:[T(r,k)], we find the coefficients assembled in <<table1>>.

A closer inspection of <<table1>> reveals that its values follow a simple recurrence relation {blank}footnote:[Note that the quantities stem:[T(r,k)] are identical with coefficients that have been listed before in another context <<bipm92-9>>, and which were then denoted by stem:[beta_j(r,2)]. The correspondence is stem:[beta_j(r,2) = T(r+1, j+1)]. In fact, it now turns out that all the coefficients evaluated in <<bipm92-9>> allow simple recurrences, namely (in the original notation) stem:[alpha_j(r,t) = t alpha_j(r-1,t) + alpha_(j-1)(r-1,t)] and stem:[beta_j(r,t) = (j+t) beta_j(r-1,t) + beta_(j-1)(r-1,t)], a property which has not been recognized previously. These relations also provide a convenient means for checking the numerical values.], namely

[[eq5]]
[stem]
++++
T(r,k) = (k+l) T(r-l,k) + T(r-l,k-l) .
++++

This reminds us of the fact that there exist similar recurrences for the binomial coefficients and for the Stirling numbers. These are known to be

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
B(n,k) = B(n-l,k) + B(n-l,k-l)
++++

and

[[eq6]]
[stem]
++++
S(n,k) = k S(n-l,k) + S(n-l,k-l) ,
++++

respectively.

A comparison with <<eq5>> and <<eq4>> immediately raises the question whether the "transfer' of recurrences is a general feature of matrix multiplication.

To approach this problem, consider a general matrix multiplication stem:[ul A xx ul B = ul C] and start with the assumed recurrences

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
A_(i,j) = alpha_1 A_(i-1,j) + alpha_2 A_(i-1,j-1) ,
++++

[[eq7]]
[stem]
++++
B_(j,k) = beta_1 B_(j-1,k) + beta_2 B_(j-1,k-1) .
++++

This gives for the element stem:[C_(i,k)] of the product matrix

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
C_(i,k) = sum_j A_(i,j)B_(j,k)
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
= sum_j (alpha_1 A_(i-1,j) + alpha_2 A_(i-1,j-1)) (beta_1 B_(j-1,k) + beta_2 B_(j-1,k-1))
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
= sum alpha_1 A_(i-1,j) (beta_1 B_(j-1,k) + beta_2 B_(j-1,k-1)) + sum alpha_2 A_(i-1,j-1) beta_1 B_(j-1,k) + sum alpha_2 A_(i-1,j-1) beta_2 B_(j-1,k-1)
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
= sum alpha_1 A_(i-1,j) B_(j,k) + alpha_2 beta_1 C_(i-1,k) + alpha_2 beta_2 C_(i-1,k-1)
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
= alpha_1 C_(i-1,k) + alpha_2 beta_1 C_(i-1,k) + alpha_2 beta_2 C_(i-1,k-1)
++++

[[eq8]]
[stem]
++++
= (alpha_1 + alpha_2 beta_1) C_(i-1,k) + alpha_2 beta_2 C_(i-1,k-1)
++++

As expected, we return to the situation given in <<eq5>> by putting stem:[alpha_1 = alpha_2 = 1," "beta_1 = k] and stem:[beta_2 = 1].

It is interesting to note in <<eq8>> that the coefficients stem:[gamma], for the product element

[[eq9]]
[stem]
++++
C_(i,k) = gamma_1 C_(i-1,k) + gamma_2 C_(i-1,k-1) ,
++++

involve not only sums, but also products of the coefficients stem:[alpha] and stem:[beta]. The coefficients stem:[gamma] are thus not symmetric in stem:[alpha] and stem:[beta].

It may therefore be worthwhile also to consider triple recurrences, i.e. relations of the form

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
A_(i,j) = alpha_1 A_(i-1,j) + alpha_2 A_(i-1,j-1) + alpha_3 A_(i-1,j-2) ,
++++

[[eq10]]
[stem]
++++
B_(j,k) = beta_1 B_(j-1,k) + beta_2 B_(j-1,k-1) + beta_3 B_(j-1,k-2) .
++++

After a similar, although longer calculation, we can show that the form of the product element stem:[C_(i,k)] is

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
C_(i,k) = [alpha_1 + beta_1(alpha_2 + alpha_3beta_1)] C_(i-1,k) + beta_2 (alpha_2 + 2alpha_3beta_1)C_(i-1,k-1)
++++

[[eq11]]
[stem]
++++
+ [beta_3(alpha_2 + 2alpha_3beta_1) + alpha_3beta_2^2] C_(i-1,k-2) + 2alpha_3beta_2beta_3 C_(i-1,k-3) + alpha_3beta_3^2 C_(i-1,k-4) .
++++

Obviously, for stem:[alpha_3 = beta_3 = 0] this reduces to <<eq8>>.

It is worth noting that not only the new coefficients stem:[gamma], introduced in <<eq9>>, become more complicated, but also that their number no longer agrees with those of stem:[alpha] and stem:[beta].

I have just been informed by Mme M. Boutillon, a colleague at the BIPM, that the following general rule holds: If the recurrence formulae for both stem:[A] and stem:[B] have stem:[m] terms (in stem:[alpha] and stem:[beta]), the recurrence for stem:[C] includes stem:[(m-1)^2+1] terms (stem:[gamma]).

This nice result explains why we find five terms in the product of triple recursions stem:[(m=3)]. In addition, it shows that only in the case of a double recursion stem:[(m=2)] - the case stem:[m = 1] is of no interest - the elements of the product matrix have the same number of terms in the recurrence.
