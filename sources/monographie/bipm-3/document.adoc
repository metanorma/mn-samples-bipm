.Preface

This monograph is one of several to be published by the Bureau International
des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) on behalf of the Comité Consultatif pour les
Etalons de Mesure des Rayonnements Ionisants (CCEMRI). The aim of this
series of publications is to review various topics which are of importance for
the measurement of ionizing radiation and radioactivity, in particular those
techniques normally used by participants in international comparisons. It is
hoped that these publications will prove to be useful reference volumes
both for those who are already engaged in this field and for those who are
approaching such measurements for the first time.

It is the purpose of this monograph to discuss the special problems that arise
when liquid-scintillation counting is used for radionuclide metrology where
the requirements are more exacting than for the routine counting of samples
in biomedical and related fields for which the technique is so widely used.
The contributions were solicited by a working group of Section II of the CCEMRI
and edited by W.B. Mann and J.G.V. Taylor, with comments on the final
draft from J. Steyn.

== Introduction

In 1970 Section II, CCEMRI, set up a small working group to look into
the "feasibility of liquid-scintillation counting for the metrology of radionuclides which decay by the emission of low-energy radiation".

At the time, liquid-scintillation (LS) counting was already well established
as the counting method of choice for the routine assay of biological and medical
samples labelled with ^3^H and ^14^C. One large university reported processing
stem:[3 xx 10^6] samples per year. This popularity had resulted in the development of
commercial instruments fitted with high-capacity sample changers and sophisticated
data-processing electronics.

The major attraction of LS counting for metrologists, essentially stem:[4pi] geometry
for even relatively low-specific-activity sources, had been found to be partially
offset by problems and pitfalls related to its major drawback, a very low scintillation
efficiency. In general these problems cannot be overcome to the extent
required for highly accurate direct activity measurements with unmodified
commercial instruments. With the aim of bringing discussions of the salient points
together with a useful bibliography under one cover, the working group solicited
the reviews that make up this volume. Unfortunately this has taken much longer
than first anticipated and these editors who took up the task in 1977 are particularly
grateful to Dr. B.W. Fox and Dr. J.A.B. Gibson who prepared first drafts
promptly and then agreed to bring them up to date several years later. No attempt
has been made to impose uniformity of style or treatment and, since the topics
are by no means independent, it has not been practical to eliminate completely
some duplication of subject matter from one part to another. In this respect
we wish to acknowledge the help of Dr. B.W. Fox and Dr. B.M. Coursey in eliminating
considerable duplication between <<partI>> and <<partII>>.

In summary, <<partI>> is the least directly concerned with metrology. It serves
as a useful introduction to the subject with emphasis on the ubiquity of LS counting
in the life and earth sciences. Despite its title, <<partII>> is not a repetition of
the material in several recent reviews on LS sample preparation; it stresses
procedures to be followed to obtain sources for standardization with the highest
possible efficiency and stability. <<partIII>> explains the physical principles underlying
the special configurations that distinguish instruments optimized for
metrology from commercial models designed for high throughput with minimal
user intervention. <<partIV>> outlines the statistical analysis and calibration procedure
required to compensate for the zero-detection probability resulting from the very
low scintillation efficiency of LS systems. The published accounts of radioactivity
standardizations made with systems using liquid scintillators are reviewed in <<partV>>.
A general review of spurious pulses was giveninan earlier monograph in this
series, and <<partVI>> deals specifically with afterpulses to which LS systems
employing sensitive phototubes at high gains are particularly susceptible.

The final part <<partVII>> gives the results of an intercomparison arranged
by the working group in which the participants measured ^134^Cs by stem:[4pi beta](LS)-stem:[gamma]
coincidence counting. It should be noted that the coincidence method does not
involve explicit consideration of the zero-detection probability <<partIV>>.
The efficiency-extrapolation problems in the two cases are quite different.
In the preparation of <<partVII>> the editors wish to acknowledge the assistance
of Dr. D. Smith and Dr. L.L. Lucas.

== Applications of Liquid Scintillation Counting in Science and Technology

=== Introduction

The introduction of liquid-scintillation (LS) counting in the mid 1950's revolutionized
the use of soft stem:[beta]-emitting radionuclides in a wide diversity of applications.
The most extensive application has undoubtedly been in the field of experimental
biochemistry concerned with drug metabolism and basic biochemical investigations
associated with problems in molecular biology.

In addition, the availability of many radionuclides, already formulated into pure
inorganic and organic chemicals, has enabled a wider diversity of disciplines
to employ LS counting in their investigations. Some 80 of these radionuclides are
listed in <<tableII-1>>. Clinical biochemistry has seen the development of body-fluid
assays and of radioimmunoassay methods. Considerable improvements in the assay
of stem:[beta]-particle emitters in very low radioactivity concentrations in aqueous solution
has also led to a wider application within such fields as hydrology, climatology and
archaeology.

As the modern LS spectrometer has been developed into an automated, high-precision
photon detector, capable of providing data in a form suitable for computer analysis,
its use has been extended to applications (not involving liquid scintillators) such as
the study of chemiluminescence, bioluminescence and the measurement of Čerenkov
radiation.

=== Experimental biochemistry

Many precursors of macromolecular synthesis, such as amino acids, nucleic acid bases
and their corresponding nucleosides and nucleotides, lipids, steroids as well as short-chain
macromolecules such as peptides and oligonucleotides are now readily available
from commercial sources, often with the radioactive label in highly specific
sites. Almost all types of tissues can now be processed rapidly to a form suitable for
efficient assay in the LS spectrometer. Early reviews of particular value are those of
Rapkin <<rap64>> (covering the years 1957 to 1963), Parmentier and ten Haaf
<<par69>> (from 1963 to 1968), Price <<pri73>> (up to 1972), and Fox <<fox76-1>>
(1973-1974). There are several publications of International Symposia <<bel58>>,
<<bra70-1>>, <<hor71-2>>, <<cro72>>, <<cro74>>, <<sta74-1>>, <<cro77>> dealing with this subject,
as well as monographs <<bir64-1>>, <<dye71>>, <<fox76-2>>, <<pen77>> covering the field of
sample-preparation techniques. A large part of this literature deals with specialized procedures developed to assay specific biological materials, some of which
were adapted to metrology studies. Basic sample preparation techniques with
emphasis on their application to radionuclide metrology are described in <<partII>>
of this Monograph.

=== Pharmacological, medical and biological applications

The use of radioactively labelled drugs in pharmacological studies has contributed,
to a considerable extent, to our knowledge of the disposition and metabolism of
such drugs in both animals and man. Many techniques have been described for
the radioassay of whole blood, plasma, urine and other body fluids as well as the
tissues themselves <<fox76-2>>. The advent of radioimmunoassay procedures <<kir71>>
has still further advanced our knowledge of physiological functions, avoiding the
problems associated with the administration of radioactively labelled substances
to patients. The accidental ingestion of soft stem:[beta]-emitters can be monitored more
accurately, e.g. ^3^H in urine. A survey <<but64>> of 300 000 samples over a tenyear
period to 1964 showed that the lower detection limit was approximately
18 kBq/ml. Also by measuring ^3^H levels in blood samples and in urine at prescribed
times after injection of trace levels of tritiated water, the total body water in
patients can be calculated, an important parameter in certain chronic disease
states <<mct71>>. Iron-absorption efficiency by the gut can also be measured by
injection of ^55^Fe intravenously, followed one hour later by an orally administered
dose of ^59^Fe, and measuring the relative levels of the two isotopes in the blood
twelve to fourteen days later <<eak66>>. ^129^I and ^125^I have been used in similar
fashion to study thyroid function <<yer63>>.

The detection and measurement of a variety of radionuclides derived from the
environment, such as fall-out from nuclear explosions, is exemplified by the assay
of ^147^Pr in urine <<lud64>>, ^32^P in foodstuffs <<ell66>> and ^239^Pu in tissue <<lin69>>.
The incorporation of organo-tin <<ash70>>, thallium and lead compounds <<lun76>>
into scintillator mixtures has increased the absorption of soft stem:[gamma] rays so that they can
be detected more efficiently in LS counters. A small volume of aqueous sample is
placed in a separate vial suspended in the scintillator. Thus total recovery of the
sample is possible.

=== Geophysical and related applications

The sensitive assay of ^3^H at low concentrations is of considerable importance in
those hydro-geological problems associated with the tracing of underground water
supplies and the direction of movement of water and brine in oil fields <<laa67>>.
Also, the movement and age of water in surface waters in ponds and lakes <<tha65>>,
as well as the problems of water movement in estuaries in connection with sewage
disposal, can be determined.

The radioassay of natural ^3^H has been much improved <<wol73>> by initially converting
water into acetic acid by reaction with acetic anhydride. The resulting ^3^H-acetic
acid is then reacted with calcium carbide to prepare acetylene which is
further polymerized to benzene. Detection limits using this procedure are reported
to be as low as one tritium atom per 10^18^ hydrogen atoms.

=== Archaeology

Carbon-14, with a 5730-year half-life, is continuously being introduced into
the biosphere at a relatively constant rate (except for nuclear explosions) by
particle reactions in the upper atmosphere. The carbon laid down in plant growth
therefore has a characteristic ^14^C to ^12^C ratio. Hence a measurement of the
proportion of the two isotopes present in a piece of ancient carbonaceous material
gives an estimate of the age of the sample.

The conventional method <<tam75>> of radiocarbon dating using LS counting is
to combust the sample in oxygen and trap the evolved CO~2~. The CO~2~ formed is
then converted to lithium carbide. Water is used to convert the carbide into
acetylene gas which is then polymerised to benzene for assay. Contemporary
carbon as benzene gives a count rate of 0.123 s^-1^ per gram of carbon, corresponding
to 95% of the 1962 National Bureau of Standards (NBS) oxalic-acid-^14^C
standard, with an overall chemical yield of 96 to 98% and a counting efficiency
of 65 to 70%. A bomb combustion method has also been described <<swi74>>
to process up to 12 g of sample.

=== Miscellaneous applications

Spectral resolutions attainable in LS counters for stem:[alpha]-emitting nuclides have been
studied in some detail by Horrocks <<hor64-3>> and by McDowell <<mcd71>>, using
such nuclides individually and in mixtures. By means of pulse-shape discrimination
techniques <<tho74>>, a more accurate discrimination of particle type can be made,
extending considerably the range of complexity of mixtures which can be analysed.

LS counting has also been applied to the study of oil distribution in petrol and diesel
engines <<eva73>>, as well as in leaks of gas-containing equipment <<bru73>>. The
"assimilation" and "mineralisation" of sea-water samples have also been measured
<<her74>> by the conversion of ^14^C-glucose into ^14^CO~2~.

=== Possible future trends

Further applications of the techniques of LS counting are inevitable, especially
as the on-line and off-line processing of data become more sophisticated. A more
detailed study of colloid-scintillation counting may lead to new ways of attacking
problems associated with biological membranes. The use of solvents with high
refractive indices or regions of anomalous dispersion may extend the application
of LS systems for Čerenkov counting (with its freedom from chemical quenching)
to radionuclides with maximum stem:[beta]-particle energies far below the 0.26 MeV
Čerenkov threshold in water <<wie78>>, <<ros70>>. Although the advent of microprocessor
technology may allow for more rapid acquisition and processing of data, it will still
be necessary to ensure that raw data are also available for checking or for alternative
treatment.

=== Introduction

This part is intended as a guide to sample preparation for radionuclide metrology
techniques employing LS counting. This material should also be useful to those
engaged in applied-science studies, such as radioimmunoassay or environmental
monitoring, which generally involve comparative rather than direct activity
measurements.

The physical and chemical properties are examined for the three types of counting
sample most often employed in standards work. A counting sample is defined here
as a sealed source containing the organic scintillator solution plus sample.
Examples are given for the preparation of such samples for a number of radionuclides
which differ in their chemical behaviour as well as in their nuclear-decay schemes.

The most often stated advantage of LS counting over other counting techniques is
that the sample may be incorporated into the detector and stem:[4pi] geometry is thereby
obtained. The ease of sample preparation and the high stem:[beta]-particle counting efficiencies
attainable for ^3^H and ^14^C-labelled biological samples have made
LS counting a major tool in life-sciences research. Lowenthal <<low74>> reported that
more than 10^7^ LS counting measurements were made annually.

By comparison, very few LS measurements are made in the field of radionuclide
metrology, the subject of the present report. It is not surprising then that most
of the problems discussed in the literature on sample preparation for LS counting
arise because an organic sample containing ^3^H or ^14^C is not in a suitable chemical
or physical form for dissolution in an organic-liquid scintillator. Several review
articles on sample preparation are available: Parmentier and ten Haaf <<par69>>,
Turner <<tur71>>, Rapkin <<rap73>>, Kobayashi and Maudsley <<kob74>>, Fox <<fox76-2>>,
Peng <<pen77>>. Most of the several hundred references cited in these reviews deal
with the specifics of how to oxidize, combust, or solubilize organic materials
so that they may be incorporated into a scintillating matrix for a comparative assay.

In radionuclide metrology, however, the choice of the composition for the counting
sample depends not so much on the organic chemistry of the sample as it does on
the chemical behavior and decay scheme of the radionuclide to be measured.
<<tableII-1>> lists radionuclides, grouped according to their chemical behavior, which
may be of interest in radionuclide metrology. Many of the references in the table
were taken from earlier reviews on this subject by Dyer <<dye72>>, Horrocks
<<hor74-3>> and Peng <<pen75>>. <<figII-1>> is a periodic chart showing the 57 different
elements which have been incorporated into LS counting samples.

The list given in this table differs from those given in previous reviews on this
subject. No attempt was mode to list all radionuclides ever counted in an LS
spectrometer. The emphasis was on the assembling of as many references as possible
which would aid the reader in preparing high-efficiency liquid scintillators.

References are not given to Čerenkov counting or counting using suspended or gel
scintillators. Short half-life daughters, such as ^113^In^m^ and ^144^Pr, were not listed
except in those instances where the daughter activity was measured after chemical
separation from the parent radionuclide. References were not included to metrology
studies in which the scintillator was not specified (e.g. ^67^Ga and ^87^Y <<ste73>>) and
one extensive list <<fra74>> (containing among others ^47^Ca, ^58^Co, ^64^Cu, ^75^Se, ^82^Br,
^99^Tc^m^, ^169^Yb) was not included because the sample preparations described there,
for use in biological studies, were considered to be inappropriate for use in radionuclide metrology. Twelve radionuclides not given here are included in a list
published recently by Joy <<joy78>>. They were not included here because no references
were given to the original work.

Most of the counting samples used in standards work fall into one of the following
three categories:

. *"Ideal" solutions* - Ideal counting samples are those consisting of an
efficient aromatic solvent and one or more scintillators at optimum concentrations.
The sample to be assayed is a simple nonquenching organic compound such as
^3^H-toluene. Calibrated seated sources of this type are often sold as "unquenched
standards".
. *"Real" solutions* - More often, the sample is only sparingly soluble in
the aromatic solvent and other agents must be added to increase the solubility.
Two common ways of doing this are to add a second polar solvent such as ethanol,
or to add a chelating agent which binds the radionuclide in a soluble complex.
. *"Liquid-liquid emulsions"* - These are the most popular counting samples
in use today. They consist of small water droplets or micelles uniformly dispersed
in the organic solvent. Non-ionic detergents are used as the dispersing agent.
The radionuclide to be measured is usually in the aqueous phase whereas the
scintillation process occurs in the organic phase.

In the remainder of the present work, these three categories are examined in
greater detail. For each of these types of samples, sections are included dealing
with general considerations, uses, and methods of preparing stable counting samples.

=== Ideal solution counting samples

[[general_considerations]]
==== General considerations of ideal solution counting samples

Most of
the advances in LS counters over the past twenty years - at least those that resulted
in greater counting efficiency - have been due to improvements in the phototubes
and in the optical and electronic design. Scintillator formulations, by comparison,
have changed very little. Now, as twenty years ago, an example of an unquenched
counting sample is ^3^H-toluene in toluene containing 3 g/l PPO and 0.5 g/l POPOP footnote:[A list of scintillators referred to in this Monograph is given in <<tableII-2>>].

Different formulations can be compared using the figure of merit given by Birks
<<bir64-1>>. The figure of merit is the number of photoelectrons arriving at the first
dynode of the phototube per kiloelectronvolt of energy deposited in the scintillator.
Its use in radionuclide metrology is discussed in <<partIII>> and <<partIV>> of this Monograph.
More recently Birks <<bir75>> has isolated those terms from the figure of merit over
which the chemist has some control and defined the product of those terms as the
scintillator figure of merit which depends upon

. the choice of the solvent,
. the solvent-solute energy transfer efficiency,
. the solute quantum yield and concentration, and
. the matching between solute fluorescence and phototube absorption.

|===

Following procedures given in Birks <<bir75>>, one can arrive at scintillator
combinations which give slightly higher scintillator figures of merit than the
toluene solution of PPO and POPOP. Tables comparing the most frequently used
LS solvents are given in Birks <<bir64-1>>. Simple aromatic compounds such as
benzene, toluene and p-xylene have long been recognized as the most efficient
solvents, for reasons described in Fuchs et al. <<fuc71>> and Laustriat et al. <<lau70>>.

The choice of scintillators is often governed by the spectral response of the phototube.
Response curves for the current bialkali phototubes, such as the RCA 8850,
Philips 56 DUVP, and EMI 9813-B, are given in the manufacturers' literature,
and fluorescence spectra and quantum yields for a large number of scintillators
are" given in Berlman <<ber71>>. Although PPO is still the most common primary solute,
terphenyl, PBD and tert-butyl-PBD are also used for some applications <<rap73>>.
For many of these solutes there is an optimum concentration beyond which the
scintillation yield decreases due to "self quenching". Optimum concentrations
for primary solutes are given in Birks <<bir64-1>> and Horrocks <<hor74-3>>. Details
of quenching caused by eximers (excited complexes containing two solute molecules)
are discussed by Horrocks <<hor71-3>>, <<hor74-3>>.

In the latest bialkali tubes, the absorption spectra sufficiently overlap the PPO
fluorescence spectrum that there is little need for a wavelength shifter. Nevertheless,
most workers continue to add the secondary solute, particularly if color quenching
due to the sample is anticipated. The three most often used are POPOP, dimethyl-POPOP
and bis-MSB. Bis-MSB is slightly more soluble in the common solvents than
the oxazoles and solubility is often the determining factor.

==== Uses of ideal solution counting samples

*Nobles gases* - As may be seen from the periodic table in <<figII-1>>,
noble gas radionuclides are among the few which have been assayed in unquenched
or ideal counting samples. At one symposium on the noble gases <<sta75>>, several
papers were devoted to LS counting. For accurate work the solubility of the noble
gas in the scintillator must be determined at the temperature at which measurements
will be made <<hor64-1>>. The solubility of these gases in toluene increases with
atomic weight, so the proportion of activity in the gas phase is relatively larger
for lighter gases, such as ^37^Ar and ^85^Kr, than it is for heavier members of the
group, such as ^133^Xe and ^222^Rn.

*Group VII A - The halides* - The halides, such as ^36^Cl and ^125^I, are
normally assayed as salts in alkaline solution. If it is necessary to prepare unquenched
samples, however, they may be converted to organic halides. An often cited
example is that of Yerick and Ross <<yer63>>, who reacted molecular iodine,
as both ^125^I and ^129^I, with an olefin by the reaction

[%unnumbered]

The alkyl halide obtained is only a mild quenching agent and is quite stable
except in alkaline solution, where the iodide groups may be replaced by -OH
groups.

Ronzani and Tamers <<ron66>> report that unquenched samples containing ^36^Cl
may be prepared by synthesizing silicon tetrachloride (SiCl~4~) which is then
dissolved in a toluene-PBD liquid scintillator.

*Groups II B and III A - VI A* - If it is necessary to dissolve radionuclides from these groups in unquenched counting samples, there are a number
of organometallic compounds available. Dimethyl-Hg, for instance, could be used
for ^203^Hg. Many organometallic compounds of gallium, indium, and selenium
are available commercially because of their usefulness in semiconductor research
<<alp76>>. Organometallic compounds of heavy elements, such as tetrabutyltin
and tetraethyl lead, are often used to increase the detection efficiency for
stem:[gamma] rays <<bir64-1>>.

Most of these organometallic compounds are synthesized by Grignard reactions.
A useful example is the work of Brodzinski et al. <<bro64>> with ^32^Si. They prepared
a nonquenching tetralkyl silicon compound by the reaction

where stem:["X" = "Br"] or stem:["F"].

The magnesium compound on the left is called a Grignard reagent. Such agents
are widely used for attaching alkyl groups to metals and some non-metals in groups
III A-VI A. In the work cited above, the ^32^Si-tetraethyl silane was introduced
into a toluene solution scintillator.

==== Preparation of ideal solution counting samples

Pure solvents and
scintillators must be used to avoid quenching caused by impurities <<pai74>>. One
can buy scintillators individually, as premixed blends, or as concentrates, which
are diluted with additional solvent to the optimum concentration. These optimum
concentrations are typically 5 to 10 g/l for the primary solute and 1 to 2 g/l for
the secondary solute.

In metrology studies two preparation methods are used for these types of samples.
The most prevalent method is to pipet the scintillator solution into the counting
vial and then to dispense an aliquot of the sample material into the vial. There
are two drawbacks to this straightforward technique. First, it is desirable to remove
oxygen from the counting sample, to minimize quenching, and one cannot easily
purge the vial after a volatile sample has been added. Second, errors in dispensing
volatile samples will be greater than those incurred in dispensing aqueous samples
in the same mass range.

Merritt <<mer73>> and BIPM <<bip75>> describe in detail the inaccuracies involved
in dispensing aqueous samples in the range 20 to 70 mg. It is exceedingly difficult
to dispense ^3^H-toluene with comparable accuracy.

The more accurate method is to spike a large quantity of the solvent (of the order
of one litre) with a small sample (1 to 5 g). Aliquots of the large batch are then
dispensed into the cells. See, for example, Garfinkel et al. <<gar65>>. In this
procedure weighing errors are much less than 0.1% because of the relatively
large masses being transferred. Deoxygenating however is still a formidable problem.

The oxygen may be removed by purging with a nonquenching gas, usually nitrogen
or argon, or by vacuum techniques. Despite the simple principles involved in
these two operations, a great deal of care is necessary to insure that part of
the sample is not removed with the oxygen. An example of a vacuum system used
for LS sample preparation is given by Johns <<joh75>>. In this system, an LS vial
with a Luer fitting is placed on a vacuum rack, the gaseous sample (^85^Kr, ^133^Xe,
^3^H-methane) is cryogenically transferred to the vial, and then de gassed scintillator
is introduced.

In another method described by Shuping et al. <<shu69>>, the solvent is refluxed
for about fifteen minutes to remove oxygen. Subsequently, the system is enclosed
and the solvent permitted to cool. The solvent may then be transferred either
in a manifold or by using an inert gas atmosphere.

=== Real solution counting samples

==== General considerations of real solution counting samples

Most
measurements in LS metrology before 1970 were made using what we have called
real solutions. That is, some other agent was added to insure the solubility of
the sample radionuclide in the solvent. The five predominant types of real
solutions are

. [[it-a]] those containing labelled cation salts of organic acids, such as ^87^Rb-octoate <<fly59>>,
. [[it-b]] those containing labelled cations complexed by alkyl phosphate chelating agents, such as ^147^Pm-diethyl hexyl phosphoric acid <<lud64>>,
. [[it-c]] binary liquid solutions, such as 8% toluene-15% ethanol, which will tolerate small quantities of water containing the sample radionuclide as an inorganic salt,
. [[it-d]] dioxane-naphthalene solutions, which may also be used with small aqueous samples, and lastly
. [[it-e]] those scintillator solutions in which organic amines are used as trapping agents for labelled anions.

Item <<it-e>> will not be dealt with here, as the use of amines for trapping ^14^CO~2~
and ^35^SO~2~ is a widely used technique and thorough reviews are available
<<kob74>>, <<pen75>>, <<pen77>>.

For most radionuclides present as cations, the choice among the first four types of
solutions is somewhat arbitrary. As a general rule the counting efficiency would
be slightly less for types <<it-c>> and <<it-d>> as ethanol is a mild quenching agent
<<hor74-3>> and dioxane-naphthalene is a poor solvent. relative to xylene or
toluene <<ncr78>>. The quenching in solutions prepared using the organic
acids (types <<it-a>> and <<it-b>> will be dependent for the most part on the purity
of the scintillators and reagents used.

Horrocks <<hor74-3>> notes that the most often used organic acids (solution type <<it-a>>
are octoic and naphthenic acids. A method of preparing cadmium, bismuth, and
lead octoates suitable for use in liquid scintillators is described by Ronzio <<ron59>>.
Many metal salts of these acids are commercially available as they are often used
as catalysts in the petrochemical industry.

The most often used chelating agent is "diethylhexyl phosphoric acid, normally
abbreviated as HDEHP. Horrocks <<hor71-1>>, <<hor74-1>>, for example, has used
HDEHP for such diverse nuclides as ^55^Fe, ^113^Sn, and natural uranium, while
Erdtmann <<erd64>> and Erdtmann and Herrmann <<erd65>> have used the same agent
for ^22^Na, ^60^Co, ^95^Zr-^95^Nb, ^124^Sb, ^144^Ce-^44^Pr and ^198^Au. HDEHP is also
widely used by inorganic and nuclear chemists for sol vent extraction studies
<<azi68>>, <<kim71>>, <<mcd71>>. Mason et al. <<mas76>>, for example, used HDEHP
to extract ^91^Y, ^147^Pm, ^152^Eu, ^170^Tm, and ^177^Lu from acid solutions into benzene.
After equilibration of the two phases, aliquots were taken from each, evaporated
to dryness, and counted with a proportional counter. Mason <<mas77>> reports that
in more recent work, they have introduced the sample aliquot from each phase directly
into an emulsion scintillator for LS counting.

Many other alkyl phosphates have, of course, been used for extracting radionuclides
into liguid scintillators. Ludwick <<lud60>> used dibutyl phosphate to introduce
^95^Zr-^90^Nb into a xylene scintillator, while Horrocks and Harkness <<hor62>> used
^63^Ni labelled dioctyl phosphate, also in a xylene scintillator. Reference to other
useful complexing agents may be found in <<dye72>> and <<pen75>>.

Too few articles in the literature on LS metrology give detailed descriptions of
the scintillator formulation used. Six papers which do contain a wealth of detail
are listed here, along with the type of solution scintillator employed and the
number of radionuclides studied (in parentheses):

Flynn et al. <<fly64>>:: toluene-ethanol-octoic acid: (10)
Dyer et al. <<dye64>>:: toluene-ethanol: (4)
Vaninbroukx and Spernol <<van65>>:: toluene-ethanol: (15) +
dioxane-naphthalene: (13)
Erdtmann <<erd64>>, Erdtmann and Herrmann <<erd65>>:: toluene-ethanol-HDEHP: (6) +
dioxane-naphthalene: (6)
Steyn <<ste67-1>>:: xylene-ethanol: (5)

The relative amounts of primary and secondary solvents differ significantly in these
works. The solvent used by Vaninbroukx and Spernol contained 89% toluene and
11% ethanol by volume while some of those used by Dyer et al. contain over 50%
ethanol. It is also interesting to compare in this regard the types of solution
scintillators used by the participants in the 1963 BIPM international comparison
of ^241^Am <<ryt64>>. This report contains details of the scintillators used by the
six laboratories who used LS counting methods (Toluene, xylene and dioxane solution
scintillators were used).

The real key to stability in these solution scintillators probably lies in selecting
the proper chemical form of the radionuclide and concentration of carrier.

Dioxane-naphthalene scintillators were developed by Furst et al. <<fur55>> over
twenty years ago, as a means of dissolving aqueous samples in an organic solvent.
In addition to the precision metrology studies cited above, these scintillators have
also been widely used for environmental measurements <<mog69>> and for biological
samples <<bra70-2>>. There seems, however, to be little reason for their continued
use. Dioxane is more toxic than toluene and p-xylene has a lower flash point,
and its naphthalene solutions are less efficient solvents. For practical applications,
the dioxane-naphthalene systems have been largely replaced by emulsion scintillators.

==== Uses of real solution counting samples

It is evident from <<figII-1>>
that most radionuclides can be incorporated into real-solution counting samples.
For noble gas radionuclides, however, there is no particular advantage to adding
solubilizing agents, as the noble gases are most soluble in pure aromatic hydrocarbons
<<hil70>>.

Sufficient examples have already been given for real-solution scintillators used for
radionuclides present as cations (^22^Na, ^87^Rb, ^60^Co, etc.). Some radionuclides
normally counted as anions are ^14^C (stem:["CO"_(overset(=)(3))]), ^35^S (stem:["SO"_(overset(=)(3))]), ^32^P (stem:["HPO"_(overset(=)(4))]), and the
halides (Cl^-^, I^-^, etc.). Such solutions are usually made basic (with KOH, for
example) to prevent escape of volatile labelled material. Solution scintillators
used for radioiodines are described by Rhodes <<rho65>>.

==== Preparation of real solution counting samples

In most experiments,
the counting samples are prepared by first pipetting the scintillator solution into
the vial and then transferring an aliquot of an aqueous solution into the vial.
For accurate work, gravimetric techniques are used, such as those described by
Merritt <<mer73>> and Vaninbroukx and Spernol <<van65>>.

The procedures described in those works are too lengthy to be reproduced here
in full. We should like to mention, however, one technique described there
<<van65>> for insuring that the sample and solution scintillator are thoroughly mixed.
First, about 0.1 ml of the aqueous sample (containing the radionuclide and appropriate
carriers) is weighed into an open 100-ml bottle. Then the sample is dissolved
in 6 ml of ethanol, 44 ml of toluene-based scintillator is added, and the bottle
is closed and shaken mechanically for 10 minutes. Individual counting samples
are then weighed into counting cells.

The main limitation to the use of toluene-ethanol scintillators is that the counting
samples are often unstable and the radionuclide may precipitate or become adsorbed
on the surface of the vial. The first point to consider when instability is recognized
is the homogeneity of the solution. If the sample is indeed a true solution (one
in which the relative proportions of constituents are the same in any differential
volume element as they are in the total sample), then several steps may be taken
to prevent the radioactive cation from being adsorbed on the container walls.
The most effective means of keeping the sample in solution is to add sufficient
inactive carrier to insure that the reactive sites on the glass surface are occupied
by inactive ions. Several examples are given by Erdtmann <<erd64>>, in which
the stability is studied as a function of carrier concentration. The amount of carrier
necessary to prevent adsorption will depend on the temperature, sample pH, and
concentrations of complexing agents.

In other work Vaninbroukx and Spernol <<van65>> added ethylene glycol with
solutions of SrCl~2~ to prevent adsorption while Smith and Stuart <<smi75-2>> reported
adding a drop of concentrated acid to the sample, a technique also mentioned
in Monographie BIPM-l <<bip75>>. One should exercise caution, however, in adding
strong acid to these solutions. Nitric and perchloric acids, in particular, may
produce explosive compounds. Concentrated acids may also accelerate oxidation
and decomposition of the fluors. A reasonable limit to the acid concentration for
these solutions would be that obtained on adding 150 mg of an aqueous solution of
4 mol HCl per dm^3^ to 10 ml of solution (90% toluene-10% ethanol, by volume).

Smith and Stuart <<smi75-2>> have also mentioned using a silicone treatment on
the surface of the glass vials. Physical and chemical models for these wall-surface
treatments are given in recent work by Harding and Dixon <<har77>> and techniques
for applying such treatments are described in Monographie BIPM-l <<bip75>>.

=== Emulsion counting samples

==== General considerations of emulsion counting samples

The commercial
emulsion scintillators in use today have evolved from the work of many investigators
over the past fifteen years. The history of the development of these scintillators
and their practical applications were discussed recently by Benson <<ben76>>. As
Fox has demonstrated in a series of papers <<fox74-1>>, <<fox74-2>>, <<fox76-2>>, the chief
advantage of emulsion scintillators is that one may incorporate relatively large
proportions of aqueous sample, and still maintain reasonable counting efficiencies.
His figure of merit for low-level ^3^H counting is proportional to the product of
counting efficiency and volume fraction of water.

The present treatment, however, will be limited to high-efficiency emulsion
counting samples, which contain less than 5% water by volume. In such systems,
water micelles are dispersed in the organic phase consisting of a solvent and
a dispersing agent. Dispersing agents are also called emulsifiers, detergents, and
surfactants. The tenn surfactant is used here since "surface-active" agent best
describes their function in these ternary mixtures.

Reference works on emulsion technology <<ben68>>, <<lis74>> reveal that a large
number of surfactants can be used to form stable emulsions. Lieberman and
Moghissi <<lie70>> evaluated many of these and found certain non-ionic surfactants
best suited for use in emulsion scintillators. The most popular of these, which
are known by the Röhm and Haas trademark Triton, are formed by the reaction
of an alkyl phenol with ethylene oxide and have the general formula

[%unnumbered]
image::img05.png[]

Generally stem:[m], the number of ethylene oxide groups, is about the same as stem:[n],
the number of methyl groups. For Triton-X 100, stem:[m = 9] and stem:[n = 8], while for
Triton N101, stem:[m = 10] and stem:[n = 9]. Another useful agent is BBS-3, a proprietary
compound distributed by Beckman <<hor76-1>>. When a small amount of water
is dispersed in a large volume of solvent, the surfactant molecules stabilize the
two-phase system by orienting themselves with the alkyl chain, or hydrophobic
end, in the organic phase and the hydrophilic end (containing the ether groups
with the unbound electrons on oxygen) in the aqueous phase.

The proportions of solvent, surfactant, and water necessary to form a stable
emulsion will depend on variables such as temperature, pH and salt concentrations
<<laa67>>, <<tur71>>, <<fox74-1>>, <<fox74-2>>. For the small samples used inm etrology
studies, it is only necessary to establish the minimum amount of surfactant required
to form a stable system. Excess surfactant will serve only to lower the scintillation
yield (although recent work <<sha74>> has shown that the aromatic surfactants do
behave as scintillators, to a limited extent). Few references are available on
emulsion scintillators which are specifically formulated to give high counting
efficiency for small samples. One such system, reported by Horrocks <<hor76-1>>,
consists of 16% BBS-3 and 84% toluene by volume. This seems to be a reasonable
lower limit to the amount of surfactant required to prevent phase separation. Most
of the commercial products on the market contain 20 to 33% surfactant by volume.

An intriguing question about these emulsion systems is whether the micelle diameters
are small compared to the range of particles emitted in the nuclear decay (or transition)
process. As early as 1967, van der Laarse <<laa67>> showed that there was
a small but significant difference in stem:[beta]-particle counting efficiency depending
upon whether the activity was in the organic scintillator phase (^3^H-toluene) or
inside the micelles (^3^H-water).

In a recent work devoted to this topic, Horrocks <<hor76-1>> determined counting
efficiency as a function of water concentration for samples of ^3^H, ^109^Cd-^109^Ag^m^,
and ^233^U. Gibson <<gib76>> at the same symposium suggested that (at least for
systems described by Horrocks <<hor76-1>>) the micelle diameters are of the order
of 10 nm or less and, therefore, energy loss within the micelles will only be significant
for a few radionuclides such as ^3^H and ^55^Fe. Gibson has suggested more
recently <<gib79>> that emulsion scintillators should not be used in metrology studies
until the question of energy loss within the micelles has been resolved.

It is usually assumed that when samples containing dissolved salts are dispersed
in these two-phase systems, the ionic species will be in the aqueous phase.
The extent to which radioactive species are extracted into the organic phase
has received little attention. It is clear however that when one adds an
extractant such as HDEHP to these emulsion systems, the radioactive sample is
extracted to some extent frOm the water micelles. This is similar in fact to
McDowell's work <<mcd71>> with actinides, in which aqueous samples are introduced
into a toluene-HDEHP "extractive scintillator". With plutonium the HDEHP
serves two purposes. First it extracts plutonium from the acidic aqueous phase and
second it prevents Pu^+4^ from polymerizing in the weak acid environment of the
organic phase <<con63>>, <<mcd71>>.

In recent work at NBS, ^239^Pu solution samples (100 to 300 mg in an aqueous solution
of 5 mol l^-1^ HNO~3~ were introduced directly into 10 ml of a commercial emulsion
scintillator and a rapid loss in count rate was observed (5% per day). Stable
samples were obtained however when the emulsion was made 0.05 molar in HDEHP.

Another "extractive scintillator" for curium, californium and americium has been
described by Miglio <<mig78>>.

==== Uses of emulsion counting samples

Radionuclides of at least 22
of the elements shown in <<figII-1>> have already been incorporated into emulsion
scintillators. Several extensive works are listed here, together with the brandname-emulsion
scintillator employed and the number of radionuclides examined (in parentheses):

Horrocks <<hor74-1>>, <<hor74-2>>, <<hor76-1>>, <<hor76-2>>:: Ready-Solv VI: (6)
Handler and Romberger <<han73>>:: Insta-Gel: (7)
Ishikawa and Takiue <<ish73>>:: Insta-Gel: (4)
Bransome and Sharpe <<bra74>>:: BBS-3 - toluene: (4)

Only recently have precise radionuclide metrology results been reported in which
emulsion scintillators were used. In the international comparison on ^139^Ce <<ryt77>>,
sponsored by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), the three
laboratories who used LS counting (IBJ, NAC, and NPL)footnoteblock:fnb[] all used commercial
emulsion scintillators. Several of the participants in the ^134^Cs international
comparison (the results of which are presented in <<partVII>> of this Monograph) also
used commercial emulsion scintillators.

==== Preparation of emulsion counting samples

Many of the procedures
given in previous sections, for preparing solution counting samples, are also
applicable for preparing emulsions. When using commercial products, however,
one should heed suggestions given by the supplier as many of these products
are formulated for specific types of samples. Some of the emulsions may appear
cloudy at first and then clear after standing for several hours. If samples are
to be counted at reduced temperature, they should be stored at that temperature
and examined before counting to insure that phase separation has not occurred.

Chemiluminescence and phosphorescence are often observed with emulsion
systems <<ben76>>. Presumably these problems are associated with impurities in the
surfactants. Some workers report reducing the chemiluminescence by pretreating
the surfactant <<ben76>>, while others find that warming the sample to 40°C reduces
this component of the background <<lie70>>. Many workers also advise doing as much
of the sample preparation as possible under red light to avoid unnecessary photoactivation.

[[figII-2]]
.Loss in count rate observed for some ^89^Sr counting samples prepared using a commercial emulsion scintillator. Measurements were made at 6°C using a Packard TriCarb, with a window fixed by a single low-level discriminator. The counting efficiency in this window was 0.995. The counting samples consisted of stem:[~~ 75" "rm(mg)] of aqueous solution (SrCl~2~ in an aqueous solution of 0.1 mol HCl per dm^3^) in 15 ml of emulsion scintillator in borosilicate-glass vials (from measurements made at NBS).

[[figII-3]]
.Relative loss in count rate due to sample adsorption for ten counting samples containing different amounts of strontium carrier and chelating agent: &#9702; strontium only, &#8226; strontium + 0.2 mmol HDEHP. Each vial contained stem:[~~ 75" "rm(ml)] of aqueous sample in stem:[7" "rm(ml)] of a commercial emulsion scintillator (from measurements made at NBS).
image::img07.png[]

The stability of counting samples can still be a problem with emulsion systems.
<<figII-2>>, for instance, shows the loss in count rate for some ^89^Sr samples
dispersed in a commercial emulsion scintillator. Note that the addition of chelating
agent alone was not sufficient to prevent the sample from being adsorbed on the
wall of the glass vial. A series of vials having different carrier concentrations
was then prepared and 1 mg of strontium per 7 ml of emulsion was found
sufficient to give a stable sample. <<figII-3>> shows the response for this series
of samples as a function of added carrier after 4.5 days.

Volatility of the sample is another problem that still has to be considered when
using emulsion scintillators. The commercial formulations are usually supplied
in acid form in order to inhibit chemiluminescence reactions <<her70>>, which may
occur when strongly alkaline clinical samples are mixed with the scintillator.
A problem occurs if a slightly alkaline sample, such as ^14^C-labelled Na~2~CO~3~,
is added to a commercial product which is acidic. In this case volatile
^14^CO~2~ may escape into the void space above the scintillator, as shown in recent
work by Herbland <<her77>> and Huskisson and Ward <<hus78>>. This problem can be
avoided for carbonate samples by first adding sufficient basic carrier solution to
neutralize the scintillator emulsion, before adding the sample.

== Design of High-Efficiency Liquid-Scintillation Counting Systems

[align=center]
*B.M. Coursey and W.B. Mann footnote:[Radioactivity Section, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C. 20234, USA.]*

=== Introduction

In order to compare LS counting systems of different design, we must first refer
to some figures of merit which have been used in this field. The most useful of
these for design purposes is the figure of merit, stem:[eta] <<swa58>>, <<bir64-1>>, which is
the number of photoelectrons arriving at the first dynode per kiloelectronvolt
of energy deposited in the scintillator. By way of comparison stem:[eta] is of the order
of 6 photoelectrons/keV for a conventional stem:[7.6 xx 7.6" "rm(cm)] Nal(Tl) detector,
while for a single-phototube LS system stem:[eta]. will be between 0.2 and 2 photoelectrons/keV depending on the design of the system. In the second part of this
section we consider methods of optimizing stem:[eta], and finally a review is given on
the LS systems that have been used in radionuclide metrology.

=== Methods of comparing liquid-scintillation counting systems

It is essential to the many instrument manufacturers that they have some agreed
basis for rating the sensitivity of different counting systems. Most commercial
counting systems consist of two phototubes and a screw-cap vial in the arrangement
shown in <<figIII-1>>. One index often used to compare these systems is the ^3^H
counting efficiency for the two tubes in coincidence, stem:[epsilon](^3^H), for a so-called
unquenched sealed standard. These standards <<ans80>> usually consist of fifteen
milliliters of deaerated liquid scintillator consisting of ^3^H-toluene, PPO and
POPOP in toluene footnote:[Chemical formulae for scintillators mentioned in this Monograph are given in <<tableII-2>>.].

In a recent intercomparison of six commercial instruments, Patterson et al. <<pat78>>
found stem:[epsilon](^3^H) ranged from 42% to 57%. Presumably these values were slightly
low because air-saturated samples were used. With unquenched standards the
manufacturers usually claim to obtain stem:[epsilon](^3^H) of 60 to 65%.

[[figIII-1]]

* Dimensions of vial are given in IEC standard 582 <<iec77>>. Reviews of the various properties of commercial vials (and smaller inserts called "minivials") are available <<pen75>>, <<nea78>>, <<rin78>>. pass:p[ +]
* "Minivials" have an outer diameter of 14 mm, and fit inside glass holders which have essentially the same dimensions as the larger vials. pass:p[ +]
* The optimum volume of scintillator depends on the system, since the stop position on the elevator shaft influences the optical geometry <<rin78>>. pass:p[ +]
* Other phototubes used in commercial counting systems include EMI QB9635 and Philips 56 DUVP.

There are some problems with using ^3^H counting efficiency as the sole gauge
of sensitivity and for radionuclide metrology work in particular it is much more
informative to specify the figure of merit stem:[eta] for the counting system. The relationship
between stem:[epsilon](^3^H) and stem:[eta_0], the merit figure uncorrected for ionization quenching,
is shown in <<figIII-2>>. See also <<ionization_quenching>>.

Almost all of the millions of measurements made annually with LS counting systems
fall in the region on the left of the figure. To reach stem:[epsilon](^3^H) in excess of 70%,
however, requires a great deal of effort. It is this high-efficiency region though
that offers the greatest promise for standardization techniques for low-energy
stem:[beta]-particle emitters and electron-capture (EC) radionuclides. Moreover, the results
reported by Kolarov et al. <<kol70>> and the Monte-Carlo calculations presented
in a series of six papers by Malcolm and Stanley <<mal74>>, <<mal76-1>>, <<mal76-2>>,
<<mal77-1>>, <<mal77-2>>, <<mal77-3>> suggest that the limits have not yet been reached
in LS-system design and further improvements are likely.

[[figIII-2]]
.Comparison of figure of merit stem:[eta_0] and ^3^H counting efficiency from Gibson and Marshall <<gib72-2>> and Gibson <<gib79>>.
image::img09.png[]

This figure was constructed by overlaying the upper and lower scales in Fig. 4
from Gibson and Marshall <<gib72-2>> and was extended to higher counting
efficiency based on more recent calculations by Gibson <<gib79>>.

The special conditions under which a quantitative relationship exists between
these two scales are discussed by Gibson and coworkers <<gal65>>, <<gib71-2>>,
<<gib72-2>>, <<gib76>> and in <<partIV>> of this Monograph.

. Counting efficiency observed for severely quenched samples.
. Typical efficiency observed for ^3^H-water samples in commercial emulsion scintillators with the type of counting system shown in <<figIII-1>>.
. Nominal upper limit for ^3^H-toluene unquenched standards in commercial counting systems.
. Kolarov et al. <<kol70>> reported stem:[epsilon](^3^H) = 73% for ^3^H-toluene in unquenched samples in a system specially designed to give high counting efficiency.

Before proceeding one other figure of merit should be mentioned, namely
stem:[epsilon](^3^H)^2^/B; where B is the background count rate expressed in counts per minute.
A good value for a commercial system would be stem:[epsilon](^3^H)^2^/B = 250, where
stem:[epsilon](^3^H) = 62% and B = 15.4 counts per minute. Although it is clearly desirable
to keep the background low, the magnitude of the total background count rate
is often less important than the way the background is distributed with pulse height,
or energy. For example, below approximately 10 keV, the background will include
a contribution from the "monos" peak (see <<hou73>> and <<figIV-2>> and <<figIV-3>> of
this Monograph). To reduce the background in this region it is usually necessary
to cool the tubes, which reduces therm ionic emissions.

In the region above 10 keV, B depends on shielding, construction materials used
for counting cell and detector, scintillator volume, and other factors as discussed
in NCRP Report 58 <<ncr78>>. Useful recent work on reduction of the background
caused by cosmic radiation is given by Alessio et al. <<ale76>>, <<ale78>>.

In the following section we will focus on design considerations for obtaining high
values for the figure of merit.

=== Considerations for optimizing the figure of merit

In this treatment we will not consider explicitly the processes of light production
and quenching in the liquid scintillator, because they have been discussed in
detail elsewhere <<bir70>>, <<hor70-2>>, <<vol69>>. Similarly we will not consider the
statistical nature of the photoelectric response process at the phototube, as that
subject is addressed in <<partIV>> of this Monograph.

Although stem:[eta] is a function of electron energy (stem:[E_e]), it is convenient to describe the
system response arbitrarily for 5-keV monoenergetic electrons. In the remainder of
this discussion, stem:[eta] values will be for stem:[E_e = 5" "rm(keV)] unless otherwise stated.

Following the treatment of Birks <<bir64-1>>, <<bir70>>, <<eqIII-3-1>> gives stem:[eta_e]
in terms of the three basic elements of the scintillation process:

stem:[g_c]:: photoelectron-collection efficiency at the first dynode.

<<eqIII-3-1>> is interesting from a design standpoint because all three terms
in brackets have to be optimized to obtain values of stem:[eta_0] in excess of 1 photoelectron/keV. The first term is a function of the chemical composition of the
sample and the third term is more or less fixed by the choice of the phototube.
The light-collection efficiency, however, depends on the selection of the
counting vial and optical arrangement and represents an important parameter
under the control of the investigator.

==== The scintillation yield

The scintillation yield is about 4.5%
for 5-keV electrons in the best liquid scintillators. Some of the problems that
limit direct measurements of stem:[S_E] are:

. the yield depends on the nature of the ionizing particle; for example, the yield for an stem:[alpha] particle is only about one-tenth that of a stem:[beta] particle of the same energy, due to differences in ionization density along the particle track <<bir64-1>>,
. the yield depends on the energy of the particle; for stem:[alpha] and stem:[beta] particles, the energy loss per unit length of path is inversely proportional to the square of the particle velocity <<bet53>> (see also <<ionization_quenching>>, ionization quenching),
. finally the yield depends on the chemical composition of the sample <<bir75>>.

Given the difficulties involved it is perhaps not too surprising that there are few
data available on scintillation yields. Most workers rely on the absolute-scintillation-
yield measurements of Hastings and Weber <<has63>> with ^3^H and ^14^C in a liquid
scintillator com.f.osed of PPO and POPOP in toluene, and those of Skarstad et al.
<<ska68>> with ^14^C in a solution of terphenyl in benzene.

Malcolm and Stanley <<mal76-1>> have combined these yield data with Horrocks'
<<hor64-2>> relative yield vs. electron-energy data to arrive at an empirical
expression giving stem:[S_E] as a function of stem:[E_e]. Using their value of stem:[S_E = 0.04] for
5 keV, and comparative data for different solvents <<bir64-1>>, <<bir75>> one would
expect stem:["S"_e ~~ 0.045] for p-xylene with an efficient scintillator such as PPO or
t-butyl PBD. Using 3.2 eV as the average photon energy (385 nm), one finds
that a 5-keV electron will produce 71 primary photons. This is the first term in
brackets in <<eqIII-3-1>>.

==== Light-collection efficiency

Estimates of the fraction stem:[G] of these
71 primary photons that reach the phototube have been very crude and range from
as low as 10% to as high as 100%. Before addressing the problem of estimating
stem:[G] we will discuss some of the design factors that must be considered in optimizing
light-collection efficiency, namely:

* average photon light-path length,
* shape of sample container,
* interfaces,
* reflecting surfaces, and
* light guides.

*Photon light-path length* - The further the photons have to travel through
the scintillator, the greater the attenuation on the photon pulse before it reaches
the boundaries of the container. The two major processes in this attenuation are

* absorption of the photons by other scintillator molecules, and
* absorption of the photons by colored impurities in the solution (referred to as color quenching).

Sipp and Miehe <<sip74>> have studied time resolution and fluorescence - absorption
in liquid-scintillator cells between two RCA 8850 phototubes. Their results clearly
show the dependence of these two parameters on the path length in the cell, which
was varied from 0.2 to 5 cm.

*Shape of the container* - It has long been recognized that certain geometrical
shapes, rectangular cells <<shu49>> and spherical vials <<pal67>>, <<mal76-1>>, for example,
are better suited for photon measurements than the cylindrical vials used in most
commercial instruments. Further evidence of light losses in the cylindrical geometry
is presented by Stanley <<sta74-2>>. Figure 6 in that reference is a photograph of
the bottom of a vial, in which the exposure is due only to the fluorescence from
the cell. The cylindrical symmetry there is shown to have a collimating effect
(a bright ring near the edge is observed) which results in excessive losses at the
bottom of the cylinder.

*Interfaces* - Clearly every interface between the scintillator and the photocathode represents a potential reflection for the photons <<gor68>>. There are two
usual ways to reduce losses at these interfaces. First, one can sandblast the outer
surface of the container <<sch66>>, to make a more diffuse surface and reduce internal
reflection. Second, one can employ optical coupling greases or fluids which have
a refractive index close to that of the cell and phototube face. The refractive index
of the liquid scintillators is about 1.50, while that for borosilicate glass, which is
used for many counting vials and is also used in the envelope for the RCA 8850, is
1.47. One useful silicone coupling grease is "Dow Corning Optical Couplant
Q2-3067" for which stem:[n_D= 1.4648].

*Reflective surfaces* - Materials most often used for reflecting surfaces are
polished aluminum, TiO~2~ (such as NE 560 from Nuclear Enterprises), MgO and BaO.
In some very early work Hayes et al. <<hay56>> looked at the efficacy of Al and TiO~2~
reflectors for scintillators which emit at different wavelengths. Some of the results
rearranged by Birks <<bir64-1>> are given here.

[%unnumbered]
|===
.2+| Scintillator 2+| Relative pulse height .2+| stem:[lambda_("max")" "rm(nm)]
| Al | TiO~2~
| TP | 0.91 | 0.76 | 342
| PPO | 1.02 | 0.97 | 375
| POPOP | 1.21 | 1.45 | 415
|===

It appears then that polished aluminum is superior if only the primary scintillator
is used. If wavelength shifters are employed however, (see <<general_considerations>>, TiO~2~ would
be better due to its better reflecting properties at longer wavelengths.

*Light guides* - Materials most often employed in light guides <<swa58>>,
<<bir64-1>> are cylindrical rods of polymethylmethacrylate (Perspex, Lucite, Plexiglas),
although quartz rods or fiber optics <<whi79>> also exhibit very high transmission.
In the close geometries employed in LS counters, however, the light guide most
often is a hollow Lucite container filled with a light-weight silicone oil of matching
refractive index, for example, Dow Corning 550 Silicone Fluid, which has a
stem:[n_D = 1.50] and a kinematic viscosity of 1.15 cm^2^ s^-l^ <<dow79>>.

*Monte-Carlo methods for calculating light-collection efficiency* - While the
details presented in the last five subsections are useful in optimizing the light-collection
efficiency, we have still not addressed the problem of how one makes
a quantitative estimate of stem:[G] to use in <<eqIII-3-1>>.

One could obtain estimates of stem:[G] using the Monte-Carlo calculations of Malcolm
and Stanley <<mal77-1>>. Their computer program allows them to simulate photon
emission, attenuation and collection processes for a given geometrical arrangement
of vial, reflector and phototubes. Thus far they have reported results for only two
arrangements, namely, for the IEC standard vial containing 20 ml of liquid scintillator,
and for a spherical vial containing, for example, 5 ml of scintillator.

Rather than use their estimates here we have elected to estimate all other parameters
in <<eqIII-3-1>> and then to solve for stem:[G] as the unknown. With this objective in mind
we consider now the phototube response.

==== Phototube response

The bracket term in <<eqIII-3-1>>, [ stem:[m" "C_(pe)" "g_c] ]
which we have called the phototube response, gives the fraction of photons arriving
at the photocathode which result in photoelectrons arriving at the first dynode, and
is about 0.25 for the typical scintillator/phototube combinations used in radionuclide
metrology. We consider now in a little more detail the three terms that make up this
response.

The spectral matching factor stem:[m] is given by

[[eqIII-3-2]]
[stem]
++++
m = (int_0^(oo)I(lambda) Phi(lambda) "d"lambda)/(int_0^(oo)I(lambda)"d"lambda),
++++

where stem:[I(lambda)] is the fluorescence spectrum of the scintillator, normalized such that stem:[int_0^(oo)I(lambda)"d"lambda = 1], and stem:[Phi(lambda)] is the photocathode response function, normalized such that the maximum value of stem:[Phi(lambda)=1].

According to Birks <<bir75>> spectral matching factors are quite high for the usual
primary scintillators with bialkali photocathodes. For instance, stem:[m = 0.97] for
PPO with a bialkali tube.

The second term stem:[C_(pe)] is the actual maximum photoelectric efficiency, or "quantum
efficiency" reported by the tube manufacturer, and does not include stem:[g_c], the
photoelectron collection efficiency at the first dynode <<iee72>>.

Details of the construction of phototubes often used in LS counting are given by
Coates <<coa70>>, Krall and Persyk <<kra72>> and Persyk and lewis <<per74>>. Typical
values for stem:[m], stem:[C_(pe)] and stem:[g] are given in <<tableIII-1>>. Of these three the stem:[g_c] value
is the most difficult to measure and it causes the greatest uncertainty in the phototube
response <<per70>>, <<per79>>.

==== Comparison of figures of merit for two liquid-scintillation counting systems

In <<tableIII-1>> we give some typical values for the parameters in <<eqIII-3-1>>, which allow an interesting comparison to be made between the commercial
system and a high-efficiency LS system. To arrive at estimates of the light-collection
efficiency, <<eqIII-3-1>> was solved for stem:[G], using the values for other parameters
shown in the table. This result indicates that about 11% of the primary photons
emitted are incident on each phototube in an arrangement such as the one shown
in <<figIII-1>>, which compares well with about 14% given by the Monte-Carlo
program for a similar geometry <<mal77-1>>, Table 2b).

[[partIII-designs]]
=== Designs for high-efficiency liquid-scintillation counting systems

<<figIII-3>> illustrates schematically some of the most commonly used geometrical
arrangements of phototubes and sample containers. Most workers use some variation
of the design used in the commercial system <<figIII-3a>> which consists of two
phototubes and an economical cylindrical vial of glass or plastic. In another popular
design shown in <<figIII-3d>>, a vial is coupled to the face of a vertically mounted
phototube. This geometry is particularly well suited for stem:[4pi beta-gamma] coincidence counters
<<smi75-2>>, because a NaI(Tl) re-entrant well crystal can be positioned around
the sample from above to give greater than stem:[2pi] geometry for the stem:[gamma]-ray detector.
Small rectangular vials, such as the ones shown in <<figIII-3c>>, are seldom used
in LS counting footnote:[Large-volume rectangular liquid scintillators have been used, however, for diverse studies such as neutrino-detection experiments and whole-body counting of small animals and humans. Useful data on the construction of such detectors may be found in Shurcliff and Jones <<shu49>> and Smith <<smi75-1>>.].

In the following paragraphs we give some additional details for three geometrical
arrangements, which, provided everything is optimized properly, should give
figures of merit stem:[eta_0] in excess of 1 photoelectron/keV. The three are:

. right-circular cylinders, in which the axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to that of the phototubes <<figIII-3a>>, <<figIII-3b>>,
. right-circular cylinders in which the axis of the cell is parallel to the axis of the phototubes <<figIII-3d>>, <<figIII-3e>>, and
. spherical vials <<figIII-3f>>.

==== Cylindrical vials perpendicular to phototube

Sensitivity can be
optimized in this geometry by using small-diameter tubing for the container. An
efficient light guide is then used between the sample container and the phototube
face <<lud60>>, <<hor64-1>>. McDowell and Weiss <<mcd76>>, in a system designed
for assaying stem:[alpha] particles, use a silicone oil-filled container as the light guide.
The inner surfaces of the light guide are painted with reflecting paint.

====

The light-collection efficiency will be better for small-radius cylinders <<hor64-3>>
and this results in higher counting efficiency for low-energy stem:[beta] particles and
better energy resolution for stem:[alpha] particles. The resolution for stem:[alpha] particles, expressed
as FWHM/stem:[E_(alpha)])( (full width at half maximum divided by stem:[alpha]-particle energy), is 20 to
25% for a 25-mm diameter cylinder, while Horrocks reported 10.7% using
vials constructed from 6-mm diameter thin-walled Pyrex tubing.

==== Cylindrical vials with axis of cylinder parallel to that of phototube

The single phototube arrangements in <<figIII-3d>> have been used extensively in
metrology work and current systems used at NPL and at NBS are of this design.
Light-collection efficiency here depends markedly on the dimensions of the scintillator.
The NPL samples, for instance, consist of 5 ml of scintillator in a cylindrical
vial, while the NBS sources consist of 3 ml in a hemispherical vial.

The light-collection efficiency is, as expected, inversely proportional to the
height of scintillator in the vial. This was demonstrated by Vaninbroukx and
Spernol <<van65>> by observing the width of the stem:[alpha]-particle peak from ^210^Po
as a function of the height of scintillator in the vial.

The second very useful arrangement <<figIII-3e>> allows one to couple the flat
ends of a cylinder directly to the faces of two phototubes <<ste67-1>>. Kolarov
et al. <<kol70>> used a quartz-spectrophotometer cell with two RCA 8850 phototubes
and obtained stem:[epsilon](^3^H) = 73% for the tubes in coincidence, and 89% in
summation. These cells are available in both glass and quartz, with specified
light paths of from 0.1 cm to 5 cm.

Although there are no data on the stem:[epsilon](^3^H) as a function of path length in these
spectrophotometer cells, there are some useful results published by Kaufman and
coworkers 20 years ago <<kau60>>, <<kau62>>, using a cylindrical container made
by connecting the faces of the two phototubes with an aluminum tube, which was
polished on the inner surface. The curves shown in <<figIII-4>> give efficiency as
a function of separation distance of the phototubes. The fact that the three curves
have different slopes is evidence of differences in the attenuation of light in the
scintillators. As we mentioned before,different concentrations of solute molecules
or colored impurities will give rise to different attenuation characteristics <<haa77>>.

==== Spherical vials

Malcolm and Stanley <<mal77-3>>, using the
Monte-Carlo method, derived a design for a system employing a spherical 5-ml
vial, in which the stem:[epsilon](^3^H) for an unquenched sample was as high as 86%.

There is some early experimental work for this geometry, but since the work was
published in Russian it appears to have received little notice in reviews on this
subject. Two of the most interesting drawings from this work by Paligorić et al.
<<pal67>> are included here in <<figIII-5>>. They did not report stem:[epsilon](^3^H) directly,
so we cannot compare their results with those derived by the Monte-Carlo method.
The figures of merit stem:[eta_(49) " "rm(keV)] of about 0.3 photoelectron/keV for each tube suggest,
however, that even though the light-collection efficiency was high, the scintillation
yield and phototube response were less than optimum. According to the English
translation, the scintillator used was composed of PPO and POPOP in dioxane.
In the usual formulations, this scintillator contains 60 grams of naphthalene per
liter of dioxane. If naphthalene is omitted from this formulation, the scintillation
yield is considerably less than that found with PPO in toluene.

It can be seen in <<figIII-5a>> that the efficiency begins to decrease for ^32^P in
the small vials due to the wall effect. This means that in designing a system for
general use in metrology one has to consider which radionuclides are to be assayed,
so that the dimensions of the container will be large compared to the range of
the stem:[alpha] or stem:[beta] particles. For the spherical vials it appears the 5 ml vial suggested
by Malcolm and Stanley <<mal77-3>> is close to optimum for low-energy stem:[beta] emitters.

In this system (see also <<figIII-3e>>, the DuMont phototube face plates formed
the ends of a cylindrical cavity containing the scintillator. The three curves are
for different scintillator formulations, and demonstrate the effect of color quenching
at longer light-path lengths.

==== Other systems

Another rather unique design of an LS counting
system for use in radionuclide metrology has been reported by Pochwalski and
Radoszewski <<poc79-1>>. In this system, three phototubes are arranged symmetrically about the axis of a cylindrical glass vial, and triple coincidence events,
as well as single and dual coincidence events, may be recorded.

Several systems are also in use which employ optical filters between the cell
and phototube to allow one to vary the counting efficiency for a single sample
<<yur71-1>>, <<poc79-2>>, <<nim80>>.

=== Conclusions

From this review it may be concluded that there is no single design for an LS
counting system that is clearly superior to others. Rather it seems that most of
the simple arrangements shown in <<figIII-3>> can be incorporated into very highefficiency
systems, suitable for use in radionuclide metrology, providing care
is taken to optimize all of the factors in system design that we have mentioned
here.

The three major requirements for a high-efficiency system design are correct
scintillator composition, good optical coupling and sensitive, matching phototubes.
When all of these are optimized as in the system used by Kolarov et al. <<kol70>>,
a superior counting system results. With currently available phototubes and good
liquid scintillators the early two-phototube designs reported by Kaufman et al.
<<kau62>>, Horrocks and Studier <<hor64-1>>, and Paligorić et al. <<pal67>> should
also give a figure of merit stem:[eta_0] in excess of 1 photoelectron/keV for each
phototube.

[[partIV]]
== The Statistics of the Scintillation Process and Determination of the Counting Efficiency

[align=center]
*J. A. B. Gibson footnote:[Environmental and Medical Sciences Division, AERE, Harwell, Oxon, UK.]*

=== Introduction

As has been indicated in earlier parts, the great advantage of the LS counter
is the absence of any source of self-absorption for truly homogeneous solutions.
However there are two serious limitations which stem from the low scintillation
efficiency of such systems and therefore limit the accuracy with which stem:[beta]-ray
and electron-capture nuclides of low maximum energy can be determined. The
limitations are

. the pulse-height distribution obtained with a liquid scintillator does not correspond directly to the input spectrum because of poor resolution and a non-linear response at low energies which results in a steep rise in the distribution at these energies,
. even if the extrapolation of integral bias curves to zero bias is feasible theoretically, then the intercepts on the ordinate do not correspond to the total number of charged particles losing energy in the scintillator and there will always be a finite probability of non-detection called the "zero-detection probability".

The poor resolution of the system also means that it is not possible to set a suitable
detection threshold which corresponds to a known electron energy. For example,
a 5-keV electron depositing energy in the scintillator will produce only about three photoelectrons at the input to the first dynode of the electron-multiplier
phototube. This is a very small number of events which have large statistical
variations about this mean of three. Subsequent amplification cannot reduce these
variations and it is found that the observed pulse-height distributions are such
that integral curves cannot be extrapolated directly to zero bias. The theoretical
analysis of such curves will demonstrate the need to fit the observations over the
full pulse-height distribution.

The detailed theory of an ideal scintillation counter was reviewed by Gale and
Gibson <<gal66>> who provided a detailed study of the statistical processes
involved in converting electron energy in a scintillator to a pulse-height distribution
fran an electron-multiplier phototube. Subsequent papers by Gibsonand
Gale <<gib68>>, Gibson <<gib72-2>>,<<gib76>> and Gale <<gal74>> established the
models required for determining this distribution both exactly and by use of mathematical
models based upon Beta and Gamma functions. The introduction of the high-gain
phototube (RCA type 8850) has largely removed the need for such functions
and a model based upon the Poisson distribution with small corrections should be
adequate for the analysis of the pulse-height distributions. As Houtermans <<hou73>>
has pointed out, "any extrapolation method is just as good as the physical model
justifying the adopted shape of the extrapolated function". The arbitrary choice
of linear or logarithmic extrapolations cannot be justified just because the result
obtained agrees with that obtained by other direct methods. However, each method
must be justified independently without reference to another method. Intercomparisons
came later.

This part is mainly concerned with outlining the methods used for calculating
the pulse-height distribution and the zero-detection probability including
a discussion of non-linear influences on this calculation. Brief comments will be
made on the effect of these statistical limitations on system design and hence
the type of additional measurement required to overcome these problems will be
discussed.

[[theoretical_pulse_height]]
=== Theoretical pulse-height distributions

Practically, the scintillation counter can be thought of as a converter (electron
energy into light), an attenuator (light into photoelectrons at the cathode of the
phototube) and an amplifier (the dynodes). Each stage of the whole process of
converting energy into an electronic pulse involves some distortion or uncertainty
so that an input of stem:[E" "rm(keV)] will produce, on average, a pulse of height stem:[bar(V)] volts
with an uncertainty of (stem:[sigma_V] where stem:[sigma_V] can be 50 or 100% of stem:[bar(V)]. In addition,
an input of stem:[2E] will not necessarily produce an output of stem:[2 bar(V)] because the_system
is non-linear. These distortions and non-linearities can be measured and explained
by mathematical models.

Starting with a single photon of light the number of electrons produced at the
first stage of the phototube by conversion in the photocathode will be stem:[bar(r)],
where stem:[bar(r) < 1], i.e., only a proportion of the light pulses produce an electron.
In the latest phototubes, the quantum efficiency of the photocathode is about 30%.
The deposition of energy along the track of a 5-keV electron in the scintillator,
if totally converted into light at 425 nm (maximum emission of a typical scintillator),
would produce 1 700 quanta. Typically, however, between 95 and 99% of
the energy goes into heating the scintillator, and only the remaining 1 to 5%
is produced as light. In a typical liquid scintillator, this scintillation yield is
approximately 1%, so that a 5-keV electron would produce about seventeen
light quanta, with about five photoelectrons at the input to the first dynode.

This is not quite the complete story because the linear rate of energy deposition
in the scintillator will also reduce the efficiency of conversion into light. At 5 keV
this "ionization-quenching" effect <<bir64-1>> amounts to about 4%, so that
a mean number of about three photoelectrons will strike the first dynode for 5 keV
of energy deposited in the scintillator. These three electrons will be amplified into
a pulse of perhaps 10^7^ electrons at the anode of the phototube with further amplification
by external electronics. However, three is the mean, stem:[bar(r)], of a Poisson distribution
in which stem:[0, 1, 2, 3, ... , r,] photoelectrons may strike the first dynode. The probability
that no photoelectron will strike the first dynode is, therefore, stem:[e^(-3) = 0.050]
which is the zero-detection probability for this energy in the system. The probability
of obtaining stem:[r] photoelectrons at the input of the first dynode is

[[eqIV-2-1]]
[stem]
++++
P_0 (bar(r),r) = e^(-bar(r)) ((bar(r))^r)/(r!).
++++

This simple theory will be developed further in subsequent sections.

[[statistics_of_the_scintillation_counter]]
==== The statistics of the scintillation counter

The pulse-height
distribution from a scintillation counter is not a simple function of the input energy
except at high energies (>500 keV) where a simple Gaussian distribution gives
an adequate representation of the output. In considering radiations from radionuclides such as ^3^H, ^55^Fe, ^63^Ni and ^14^C, such an approach is not correct. Neither
can the output be considered as a Poisson distribution at low energies because
the phototube modifies this distribution at the input and produces a variance in excess
of that expected from the Poisson distribution. This additional distortion is small
for the modern high-gain phototubes.

Gale and Gibson <<gal66>> reviewed the mathematical methods used to describe
the pulse-height distribution for a single-electron input to the first dynode and
produced generating functions for any number of electrons and also for an input
with a Poisson distribution. The formulae developed in an earlier paper <<gal65>>
are as follows. The probability of obtaining stem:[n] electrons from the stem:[k]th stage of
the phototube from an input to the first dynode of exactly stem:[r] electrons is

where stem:[m_k = "gain of the "k"th stage "(k = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)].

It will be noted that the probability distribution is calculated from the single-electron
output from the stem:[(k - l)]th stage and can be calculated directly for any
particular value or stem:[r], independent of a calculation of any other value of stem:[r].

stem:[P_k(1,0)] and stem:[P_k(r,0)] are the zero-detection probabilities and the generating
functions are based upon the Poisson distribution <<eqIV-2-1>>. The pulse-height
distribution from an input to the first dynode distributed with a Poisson mean of stem:[bar(r)] electrons is

[[eqIV-2-5]]
[stem]
++++
P_k(bar(r),n) = r/n sum_(i=0)^(n-1) (n-i)*P_k(r,i)*P_k(1,n-i)," for " n!=0," and "k >=1,
++++

and

[[eqIV-2-6]]
[stem]
++++
P_k(bar(r),0) = "exp"(-bar(r))*"exp"{bar(r)*P_k(1,0)}.
++++

The output is again derived from the single-electron input, but this time at the stem:[k]th
stage. Similar generating functions have been derived by Prescott <<pre66>> to take
account of non-uniformity in the dynodes of the phototube and they contain the
Poisson distribution as a special case. However, as has been shown by Coates
<<coa70>>, this additional complication is unnecessary if a high-gain phototube
is used.

The major problem with this exact model is the amount of computer time required
to produce a pulse-height distribution and Gale and Gibson <<gal66>> proposed an
algebraic approximation in the form of a Gamma function to reduce the computing
time. However the introduction of the RCA phototube with a first stage gain of
between 30 and 35 has reduced the necessity for such an approach because the
distortion introduced by the dynodes is small. For example the mean and variance
calculated using the generating functions above are:

Mean:: stem:[mu = bar(r) * m_1 * m_2^(k-1),]

Variance:: stem:[sigma^2 = bar(r) * m_1^2 * m_2^(2(k-1)) {1+ (m_2)/(m_1(m_2-1))}.]

An initial stage with a gain of stem:[m_l] and subsequent stages of gain stem:[m_2 = m_3 = m_4 = ... = m_k] are assumed. The relative variance is

[[eqIV-2-7]]
[stem]
++++
(sigma^2)/(eta^2) = 1/r {1+ (m_2)/(m_1(m_2-1))}.
++++

At the input of the first stage, the relative variance is stem:[1//bar(r)] so that the term in
the brackets in <<eqIV-2-7>> represents the additional distortion introduced by the
dynodes. Now if stem:[m_1 = 35] and stem:[m_2 = 4], the relative variance is stem:[1.038//bar(r)] and the
relative standard deviation is stem:[1.019//sqrt(bar(r))]. This means that the width of the peak
from a single (mono) or multielectron input is increased by less than 2% over
that expected for a Poisson distribution. The effects on the zero-detection probability
are not detectable (stem:[~~ 10^(-14)]) and so it is reasonable to assume that a Poisson distribution
can be used to represent the pulse-height distribution from this type of
phototube. Other tubes with a lower first-stage gain require the more exact
approach discussed above.

==== Pulse-height distributions

An excellent review of the output
from the RCA 8850 phototube was prepared by Houtermans <<hou73>> and he shows
the pulse-height distribution from single photons for this phototube <<figIV-1>>.
The relative peak width at half maximum (FWHM) is 41%, which is a function
of the relative variance such that, for a Gaussian distribution,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
("FWHM")^2 = (sigma^2)/(mu^2) * 8 "ln" 2 = 8/(bar(r)) "ln" 2.
++++

[[figIV-1]]

image::img19.png[]

Thus stem:[bar(r) = (8 "ln" 2)//0.41^2 = 33], which is equal to the first stage gain (stem:[m_1]) as given
in the manufacturers' specification. The distribution below the peak is due to edge
effects <<coa70>> but, by careful choice of the tube, these can be reduced to
a minimum (peak to valley > 5). The dark noise should also be minimised and it is
important to have a high quantum efficiency for the photocathode.

In the ideal situation, the distribution would be purely Poissonian and the result
of having stem:[r = 2, 3, 4, ...] electrons incident at the same time would produce
a series of distributions with means of 66, 99, 132, and so on. If an input to
the first stage is itself distributed according to the Poisson distribution, then it is
necessary to add together the contributions such that the final distribution may be
approximated by the distribution at the output of the first stage, viz,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
P_k(bar(r),n) ~~ P_1(bar(r),n) = sum_(i=1)^(oo) P_0(bar(r),i) * P_0(bar(m_1i),n),
++++

where stem:[m_1] is the gain of the first stage and stem:[P_0] is the Poisson distribution as defined
by <<eqIV-2-1>>. Thus

[[eqIV-2-8]]
[stem]
++++
P_k(bar(r),n) ~~ P_0(bar(1),n)*"exp"(m_1-bar(r)) * sum_(i=1)^(oo) (i^n)/(i!) (bar(r))^i "exp"(-m_1i).
++++

[[figIV-2]]

image::img20.png[]

For a more exact calculation, to allow for the edge effects on the dynodes,
the generating functions produced in <<statistics_of_the_scintillation_counter>> can be used. The spectrum
of monos that is measured can be used instead of the Poisson distribution. The zero-detection
probability is unchanged because the major contribution (>99.99%)
is due to the input distribution to the first dynode.

[[figIV-3]]
.Measured pulse-height distribution of ^55^Fe <<hou73>> (courtesy North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam).
image::img21.png[]

Houtermans <<hou73>> used the measured mono-electron distribution to calculate
the spectra expected and these are shown in <<figIV-2>>. The actual observed
spectrum for ^55^Fe given in <<figIV-3>> shows the peaks from 1, 2, 3 and 4 monos
as expected by the theory. The value of stem:[bar(r)] in this figure is between 2 and 3 <<hou73>>.

This distribution demonstrates the difficulty of defining an equivalent energy
threshold. At higher energies the input will be a Gaussian distribution and the
resolution into quantised peaks will not be observed. An example is also shown
by Houtermans for ^113^Sn+ ^113^In^m^ <<figIV-4>>, with an input energy of about
380 keV. The FWHM is 15.5%, which corresponds to a mean number of monos
of 231. In the actual determination of stem:[bar(r)], it is necessary to allow for the double
peak at 368 and 392 keV and this partially accounts for the difference from
a value of stem:[bar(r) = 264] calculated from the peak position.

[[figIV-4]]
.Measured pulse-height distribution of ^113^Sn + ^113^In^m^ <<hou73>> (courtesy North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam).
image::img22.png[]

Thus it is possible to calculate the pulse-height distribution from a single phototube
for the measured parameters in the system. However, in order to do this,
the non-linear effects must be included and these are considered in <<non_linear_effects>>.

==== The pulse-height distribution for a coincidence system

Most modern systems are arranged so that the outputs of the two phototubes are added
when a pulse is observed in both tubes (see for example Gibson and Lally <<gib71-3>>).
Thus since both tubes are required to produce a pulse, then there will be the equivalent
of at least two photoelectrons in each detected event. For an input of
exactly stem:[i] electrons shared randomly between the two phototubes the output is
reduced by a factor corresponding to the probability of all stem:[i] electrons being
detected by one of the phototubes. The factor is stem:[(1 - 2^(1-i))] as quoted by Swank
<<swa58>>, but it can be deduced simply from the binomial distribution.

Thus, in calculating the spectrum from a Poisson-distributed input to the first
dynode <<eqIV-2-8>>, this factor must be included, i.e.

[[eqIV-2-p]]
[stem]
++++
P_k^c (bar(r),n) ~~ sum_(i=2)^(oo) P_0 (bar(r),i) * P_0(bar(m_1i),n) * (1-2^(1-i)).
++++

As discussed by Jordan <<jor71>>, stem:[bar(r)] can be less than 2 or less than 1 and there is
still a finite probability of detection with a coincidence system.

[[pulse_height_beta_ray]]
==== The pulse-height distribution for a stem:[beta]-ray spectrum

The distribution
for a spectrum of electrons can be calculated by dividing it up into a sufficient
number of discrete energy bands of mean energy, stem:[E_j], which, when multiplied
by the appropriate figure of merit (stem:[eta] electrons/keV, give a value of stem:[bar(r)] such that

[[eqIV-2-10]]
[stem]
++++
bar(r) = eta E_j.
++++

stem:[bar(r)] can be used with <<eqIV-2-7>> or <<eqIV-2-8>> and weighted according to the proportion
of the spectrum in the energy band stem:[E_j - Delta E//2] to stem:[E_j + Delta E//2]. The weighting factors,
stem:[H(j)], when integrated over the spectrum, are equal to unity. Thus the pulse-height
distribution is obtained from

[[eqIV-2-11]]
[stem]
++++
S(eta) = sum_(j=1)^J H(j) P(eta E_j,n),
++++

where stem:[J], the number of elements in the spectrum, is normally about twenty depending
upon the degree of precision required. There is little point in using element
widths, stem:[Delta E], much less than the resolution of the system. It should be noted that stem:[eta] is not independent of stem:[E] at low energies (see <<ionization_quenching>>.

==== Electron capture and internal conversion

X rays and electrons
from electron-capturing (EC) nuclides and internal-conversion (IC) transitions
can usefully be used to measure the figure of merit, stem:[eta], for the system and as was
shown in <<figIV-3>>, they also are used to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical
calculation of the pulse-height distributions. However to calculate the complete
distribution it is necessary to consider all possible modes of decay involving
the production of cascades of Auger electrons and X rays (from the L, M, N, ...
shells) which may escape from the scintillator without interacting. In some cases,
fifteen or more alternative modes of decay are possible and <<figIV-5>> indicates
the sort of analysis required for the calculation. IC transitions often do not occur
singly either because of the ejection of both K and L electrons with appropriate
probabilities or because two or more transitions produce electrons of similar energy.
Consideration of these effects is important in assessing the peak position and vital
in using the resolution of the peak to determine the figure of merit. This point was
discussed above for the decay of ^113^Sn + ^131^In^m^ <<figIV-4>>.

Having decided upon the input spectrum, the same approach can be adopted as for
stem:[beta]-ray emitters and values of stem:[H(j)], based upon this assumed spectrum, inserted into <<eqIV-2-11>>.

[[figIV-5]]

==== The Compton edge

It is necessary to measure the response of
the system to a wide range of energies in order to determine the extent of the
non-linear response of the scintillator. There are insufficient nuclides decaying
by isomeric transitions, with the ejection of monoenergetic electrons, so that
it is necessary to use Compton-recoil electrons of maximum energy (the Compton
edge) from a series of external stem:[gamma]-ray sources. The energy for the maximum transferrance
of energy to the scintillator is given by

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
E = E_(gamma) [1+E_(gamma)//(m_0c^2)]^(-1),
++++

where stem:[E_(gamma)] equals the incident stem:[gamma]-ray energy and stem:[m_0c^2] is the rest mass of the
electron in appropriate energy units, such that stem:[E_(gamma)//m_0 c^2] is dimensionless.
The shape of the Compton spectrum is a function of the energy, and the appropriate
function is given in various sources (e.g. <<eva68>>). This theoretical spectrum can
also be divided up into energy bands, weighted by stem:[H(j)], and the output distribution
calculated using <<eqIV-2-11>>.

It is conventional to take the point corresponding to half the maximum height as
the position of the Compton edge. This may lead to small errors in calibration but
this should not affect the calculation of the overall counting efficiency.

The position of the Compton edge is also used by Horrocks <<hor76-1>> as a means
of determining the degree of quenching in a liquid scintillator. His method is
relative, but it is very useful for checking that a particular sample conforms to
the operating parameters of the system.

=== The counting efficiency

In <<theoretical_pulse_height>> it has been shown that the pulse-height distribution can be calculated and
compared with measured distributions. Integrating this distribution, including all
monos, will give the total of all detected events stem:[N]. As mentioned earlier, the
efficiency, stem:[epsilon], will not be 100% and it is now necessary to demonstrate how
it can be calculated so that stem:[N_0 = N//epsilon] can be deduced.

==== The counting efficiency for a single phototube

Starting with
a monoenergetic source of electrons in the scintillator, the number of electrons
at the input to the first dynode will follow a Poisson distribution of mean stem:[bar(r)]. The
zero-detection probability, stem:[Z], is stem:[e^(-bar(r))] and the efficiency

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
epsilon = 1-Z = 1-e^(-bar(r)).
++++

With the RCA tube, there is no further reduction in efficiency in the phototube.
The presence of the low-energy tail on the mono distribution has less than a
0.01% effect. Unfortunately no radionuclide decays with a single electron energy,
so it is always necessary to determine the counting efficiency by means of an
integral, or a summation. It is also necessary in the practical case to use a
summation as discussed in <<pulse_height_beta_ray>>, <<eqIV-2-11>>. The efficiency stem:[epsilon_1(beta)] for a single phototube is then given by

[[eqIV-3-1]]
[stem]
++++
epsilon_1(beta) = 1 - sum_(j=1)^J H(j) * "exp"{-eta * E(j)},
++++

where stem:[eta] is the figure of merit (photoelectrons/keV) and stem:[E] is the energy in stem:[rm(keV)].

The spectral characteristics of most stem:[beta] emitters are known and calculation methods
based upon the Fermi theory can be used <<eva55>> to evaluate stem:[H(j)]. A similar
approach can be made for EC nuclides where the contributions from the Auger
electrons and X rays need to be included <<gib72-2>>.

==== The counting efficiency for two phototubes in coincidence

Again
starting with a monoenergetic source of electrons and two phototubes in coincidence,
if the zero-detection probability for phototube stem:[A] is stem:[Z(a)] and for photofube stem:[B] is stem:[Z(b)], then the efficiency is

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
epsilon_c = {1-Z(a)} {1-Z(b)}
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
= {1-Z(a)-Z(b)+Z(a+b)}
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
= {1-e^(-bar(r)(a)) - e^(-bar(r)(b)) + e^(-[bar(r)(a)+bar(r)(b)])}
++++

The efficiency for counting a stem:[beta]-ray emitter is then obtained by summation,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
epsilon_c(beta) = 1 - sum_(j=1)^J H_j {"exp" [-eta(a)E(j)] + "exp"[-eta(b)E(j)] - "exp" [(-eta(a) - eta(b)) * E(j)]},
++++

where stem:[eta(a)] and stem:[eta(b)] are the figures of merit for phototubes stem:[A] and stem:[B] respectively.

The counts from the two phototubes separately and then in coincidence can be
expressed as three independent simultaneous equations

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_1 = N_0 * epsilon_1 = N_0 {1-F(a)},
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_2 = N_0 * epsilon_2 = N_0 {1-F(b)} " and "
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_c = N_0 * epsilon_c = N_0 {1-F(a)-F(b)+F(a+b)},
++++

where stem:[F(y) = sum_(j=1)^J H(j) "exp" [eta(y) E(j)\]], with stem:[y = a, b] or stem:[a + b].

Thus with the measured values stem:[N_1], stem:[N_2] and stem:[N_c] and three unknowns, stem:[a], stem:[b] and
stem:[N_0], Tissen <<tis58>> and, later, Kolarov et al. <<kol70>> suggested that stem:[N_0] could
be determined. However it is necessary to know the form of the summation stem:[F]
since for a stem:[beta]-ray spectrum stem:[F(a)* F(b) != F(a+b)].

In general, it will be better to compare the calculated and measured distributions
before calculating the counting efficiency by one of the above methods.

[[non_linear_effects]]
=== Non-linear effects

There are various effects in a scintillation counter which can lead to the output
not being proportional to the input. The statistical variations have been discussed
above and some of the non-linear effects have already been mentioned including
ionization quenching, boundary losses and non-uniformity in the phototube
cathode and dynodes. These effects will be discussed below.

[[ionization_quenching]]
==== Ionization quenching

As mentioned in the introduction to this
chapter, the energy transfer from the initial energy deposition in the scintillator
to light output is very inefficient (1 to 5%). If the ionizing particle deposits
energy in a very short track length (high dE/dx) as is observed for stem:[alpha] particles
and low-energy electrons then, as Birks <<bir64-1>> has shown, there is a further
reduction in the scintillation efficiency. Birks used the term "ionization quenching"
to describe this loss and produced an equation which can be derived from the
Stern-Volmer <<ste19>> theory of quenching, for a first-order effect, as the rate
of light output per unit track length,

[[eqIV-4-1]]
[stem]
++++
("d"L)/("d"x) = (eta_s "d"E//"d"x)/(1+kB" d"E//"d"x),
++++

where stem:["d"E//"d"x] is the specific energy loss (normally expressed in MeV cm^-2^ g^-1^),
stem:[k] is a rate constant and stem:[B"d"E//"d"x] is the concentration of ionizing events. Other
workers have included a further term stem:[C("d"E//"d"x)^2] in the denominator and Voltz <<vol69>>
proposed an equation of the form

[[eqIV-4-2]]
[stem]
++++
("d"L)/("d"x) = eta_s ("d"E)/("d"x) "exp" {- (kB"d"E)/("d"x)}.
++++

<<eqIV-4-1>> due to Birks <<bir64-1>> is to be preferred but the use of alternatives
may be necessary if an appropriate fit to the observed data cannot be obtained.
The meaning of the terms in <<eqIV-4-1>> will now be explained. The value of
the constant stem:[kB] is about stem:[9" "rm(mg)" "rm(cm)^(-2)" "rm(MeV)^(-l)] and thus for stem:[beta] particles and electrons
with energies greater than about stem:[1" "rm(keV)], where stem:["d"E//"d"x = 100" "rm(MeV)" "rm(cm)^(-2)" "rm(g)^(-l)],
the <<eqIV-4-1>> and <<eqIV-4-2>> give similar results (stem:[53 eta_s] and stem:[40 eta_s], respectively).
Here stem:[eta_s] is defined as the figure of merit for the scintillator when stem:["d"E//"d"x] tends to
zero (i.e. high stem:[beta]-ray energies). If stem:[kB " d"E//"d"x] is small compared to 1, then the light
output from an electron of energy stem:[E] is

[[eqIV-4-3]]
[stem]
++++
L = eta_s int_0^R (("d"E)/("d"x))"d"x = eta_s int_0^E "d"E = eta_s E,
++++

and stem:[eta_s = L//E] is the light output per unit energy input. A second figure of merit for
the complete system is stem:[eta_0 = lambda L//E], where stem:[lambda] is the photocathode efficiency. In the
general case when stem:[kB " d"E//"d"x] is not small compared to 1, then

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
L(E) = eta_s int_0^E ("d"E)/(1+kB" d"E//"d"x) = eta_s * E * Q(E),
++++

where stem:[Q(E)] is obtained by numerical integration. Thus in general

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
eta_(E) = (lambda * L(E))/E = eta_0 Q(E).
++++

The shape of stem:[Q(E)] is dependent upon the value chosen for stem:[kB] and an example with
stem:[kB = 9" "rm(mg)" "rm(cm)^(-2)" "rm(MeV)^(-l)] is given in <<figIV-6>>, which was calculated using a modified
form of the Bethe-Bloch theory for stem:["d"E//"d"x] <<nel56>>, with stem:["d"E//"d"x] proportional
to stem:[E^(-0.5)] below stem:[400" "rm(eV)] <<mar70-1>>.

[[figIV-6]]
.Variations of scintillation efficiency with electron energy due to ionization quenching and wall effects <<gib68>> (courtesy Institute of Physics, London).
image::img24.png[]

It should be noted that for stem:[alpha] and other charged particles, when stem:[kB" d"E//"d"x > > 1],
<<eqIV-4-1>> reduces to

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
("d"L)/("d"x) = eta_s/(kB)
++++

and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
L = (eta_s)/(kB) int_0^R "d"x = (eta_s)/(kB) * R(E)
++++

and the light output is proportional to the range of the particle, not to its energy.

==== Boundary losses at high electron energies

One major difficulty
in determining stem:[eta_0] at high electron energies is that a significant proportion of
the energy may be lost into the walls of the scintillator cell and out of the surface
of the scintillator. This will distort the spectrum and may give misleading results.
Benjamin et al. <<ben62>> derived a formula for the fraction of energy deposited
within a cylinder of radius stem:[r] and height stem:[h], such that

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
W(E) = 1 -0.5{1/r + 1/h} R(E),
++++

where stem:[R(E)] is the range of an electron of energy stem:[E] <<nel56>>. As far as possible
the energy lost to the boundaries should be reduced to a minimum so that corrections
to the observed spectrum are unnecessary. Normally this boundary loss is not
sufficient to reduce the counting efficiency as enough energy will be deposited
in the scintillator to produce a detectable output from the phototube and this effect
is only important in setting up a system. Illustrative values of stem:[W(E)] are shown
in <<figIV-6>>.

==== Loss of photon radiation from the scintillator without interaction

This problem arises in three cases:

. in the loss of X rays after electron capture,
. where a nuclide decays by an isomeric transition without emitting a stem:[beta] particle or an electron and only stem:[gamma] rays are produced (e.g. ^137^Ba^m^) and
. where the liquid scintillator is used as the stem:[beta]-ray detector in the stem:[4pi beta - gamma]
coincidence method (e.g. <<erd65>>).

Gibson and Marshall <<gib72-2>> calculated the probability of escape for a right
circular cylinder of radius stem:[a = 10.5" "rm(mm)] and half length, stem:[l = 27.75" "rm(mm)], based upon
the following integral for the total probability of escape

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
J(E) = (int int e^(-mu d) "d"Omega "d"V)/(int int "d" Omega "d"V),
++++

where the solid angle stem:["d"Omega = "sin" theta "d"theta "d"Psi] with the integral of stem:[theta] from stem:[0] to stem:[pi] and
stem:[Psi] from stem:[0] to stem:[pi] as well. The volume element stem:["d"V = x"d"x"d"z] <<figIV-7>> where the
radial term, stem:[x], is integrated from stem:[0] to stem:[a] and the axial term, stem:[z], from stem:[0] to stem:[1],
the half length of the scintillator. The divisor can be integrated analytically
to give stem:[pi a^2 l" "(= V//2)] and the numerator integral must be solved numerically
using tabulated values of the mass attenuation coefficient, stem:[mu_a], for different photon
energies (e. g. <<eva68>>. The distance, stem:[d], from the point of origin of the X ray
to the boundaries of the scintillator is complicated to calculate. Thus the escape
is considered in three parts:

. top of the cylinder,
+
--
[align=left]
stem:[mu_a d = mu_a (l-z) "cos" theta], +
with integration limits for stem:[theta] from stem:[theta = 0] to stem:[theta = theta_1 = "tan"^(-1) {(-x "cos" Psi +- f)/(1-z)}],
--
. curved section,
+
--
[align=left]
stem:[mu_a d = - mu_a (x"cos"Psi +- f)// "sin" theta], +
with integration limits for stem:[theta] from stem:[theta=theta_1] to stem:[theta=theta_2 ="tan"^(-1){(-x"cos"Psi +- f)/(-1-z)}],
--
. bottom of the cylinder,
+
--
[align=left]
stem:[mu_a d = -mu_a(1+z)//"cos"theta], +
with integration limits for stem:[theta] from stem:[theta=theta_2] to stem:[theta=pi].
--

[[figIV-7]]
.Geometry used in calculating the escape of photon radiation from the scintillator cell <<gib72-2>> (courtesy Pergamon Press Ltd., Oxford).
image::img25.png[]

The limits for stem:[Psi] are stem:[0] to stem:[pi], for stem:[x] from stem:[0] to stem:[a] and for stem:[z] from stem:[0] to stem:[1]. The function
stem:[f] above is given by

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
f = (a^2 - x^2 "sin"^2Psi)^(1//2).

The value of stem:[1 - J(E)] for a stem:[15" "rm(cm)^3] volume with stem:[a = 10.5" "rm(mm)] and stem:[l = 21.75" "rm(mm)]
is plotted as function of energy in <<figIV-8>> and shows that this correction is
important above about stem:[2" "rm(keV)]. The efficiency for counting Auger electrons is
also shown in this figure for two values of the figure of merit, stem:[eta_0 = 0.5] and
1.0 photoelectron/keV (stem:[eta_0//2] for each phototube).

==== Other effects

There are many minor effects which can distort
the spectrum and hence lead to a loss of counting efficiency. Starting with the
scintillator and vial, it is important to ensure complete solubility with no plating
out on to the vial walls. Colour and chemical quenching distort the spectra
in different ways. In the case of chemical quenching the effect is equivalent
to a gain change such that

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
g = (1+kw)^(-1),
++++

where stem:[k] is the rate constant in the Stern-Volmer <<ste19>> equation and stem:[w] is the
concentration of the quenching agent per unit volume of the scintillator <<gib67>>.
Thus the figure of merit, stem:[eta_0], is reduced to stem:[g eta_0]. Colour quenching introduces
a more subtle distortion because light produced close to the photocathode is not
absorbed butt hat from deeper in the scintillator may be lost completely. It is better
to reduce quenching to a minimum in direct counting, but checks must still be made
to make sure this objective is achieved. The vials should be as uniform as possible
so that the light escapes equally to both phototubes in a coincidence system.
The vial should be well coupled optically to the phototubes to avoid internal
reflections.

The photocathode may be non-uniform as shown by Stanley and Malcolm <<sta77>>
and it may be necessary to limit the area used to avoid distortions in its response.
The collection efficiency of the first dynode needs to be as good as possible and
inhomogeneities in all dynodes should be minimised. Coates <<coa70>> has demonstrated
that edge effects in the dynodes are the major source of spectral distortion
with the RCA tube and must be allowed for in calculating the pulse-height distribution.
Photoemission from the first dynode is unimportant with a phototube of the
RCA type. Instrumental effects due to a poor high-frequency response in the electronics
or to poor layout of phototube on other connectors giving rise to ringing or reflections
must be avoided. Dead times in excess of stem:[100" "rm(ns)] may be required to avoid this problem.

Afterpulses in the phototube can cause problems but this will be discussed in
a later chapter. Equally, long decay times in the scintillator may produce similar
effects and should be avoided. In general a careful survey of the system is required
on setting up and at regular intervals to ensure that ageing effects do not change
any of the parameters or introduce interfering effects.

=== System design and testing

Most commercial instruments for coincidence counting are designed to minimise
the user interaction with the parameters of the system. However modification of
a commercial instrument may prove to be the most economical way of setting up
a system for direct counting. The choice of phototubes is restricted to the special
RCA 8850 phototube with the first dynode of GaP(Cs) with a high gain (>30).
These phototubes should be carefully selected with a high peak-to-valley ratio
(>5), with low noise and a similar gain. The photocathodes should be uniform.
The dynode chain, connectors and electronics should be designed to reduce after
pulses and ringing. The phototubes should be tested with a light source and with
^55^Fe in a liquid scintillator. Both phototubes should be set to count monos. It is
necessary to provide outputs to a pulse-height analyser for both tubes singly and
summed in coincidence if proper analysis is to be performed.

The liquid scintillator needs to be chosen with equal care to ensure adequate
solubility for the radionuclide to be standardised and to reduce quenching to
a minimum. Studies of the effect of colour and chemical quenching should be made
using an external-source method (e.g. <<hor76-1>>) and the sample channel-ratio
method. The source is ideally positioned at the side of the counting vial to reduce
effects due to variations in the thickness of the vial wall. The "H number" concept
of Horrocks <<hor76-1>> is independent of such an effect and measures the changes
in scintillation efficiency directly.

Having chosen the system and the scintillator, it is then necessary to determine
the figure of merit as a function of energy by using EC nuclides, IC transitions
and the Compton-edge position. Supplementary information can be obtained from
measurements of the resolution of the peaks provided corrections are made for
multiple decays of similar energy. The measured data can then be used to determine
the ionization quenching constant stem:[kB] in <<eqIV-4-1>>. Any changes in the system
or the scintillator will involve a remeasurement of stem:[kB].

The decay scheme of the radionuclide under investigation should be considered,
and in the case of a stem:[beta]-ray emitter it is necessary to know the spectral shape. Any
X or stem:[gamma] radiation associated with the decay should be included and the interaction
probability within the scintillator calculated. Finally the full pulse-height-distribution
should be calculated for comparison with the measured value. It is then
possible to integrate the area under the distribution and so determine the total count
rate. The efficiency can be calculated from the theoretical pulse-height distribution.
This is the only really effective method for low-energy emitters as any form of extrapolation
will involve assumptions of linearity which are difficult to justify in practice
and no tests of the method proposed by Kolarov et al. <<kol70>> have been reported.

Finally it is necessary to assess the uncertainties in the measurement. These will be
less than the zero-detection probability, stem:[Z], and will depend upon the systematic
uncertainties in the ionization-quenching constant, stem:[kB], and the high-energy figure
of merit, stem:[eta_0]. Some uncertainty must be placed upon the knowledge of the spectrum
and on calculations of the escape probabilities of photon radiation. Counting
statistics are to be included in the random uncertainty as must any corrections
for afterpulses, background and accidental coincidences due to chemiluminescence.
Normally these can be reduced to an uncertainty much less than 0.5%.

A simple demonstration of the analysis of uncertainty can be given, as follows.
The zero-detection probability stem:[Z] is approximately equal to stem:[e^(-bar(r))], where stem:[bar(r) = etaE].
Thus stem:["d"Z//Z = -"d"bar(r) = -"d"eta * E] or the fractional uncertainty in stem:[Z] is proportional to
the uncertainty in ill, the figure of merit. Also the fractional uncertainty in the
counting efficiency stem:[epsilon], is stem:["d"Z//epsilon] so that, if a 5-keV electron in the scintillator
produces three photoelectrons at the first dynode (stem:[eta_0 Q(E) = 1 xx 0.63]), assuming
that stem:[eta] is measured to stem:[+-10%] (standard deviation), then

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
("d"Z)/epsilon = (0.1*3*e^(-3))/(1-e^(-3)) = 1.6%.
++++

This corresponds, very approximately, to the accuracy obtainable for a direct
measurement of tritium <<gib72-1>>. A more precise calculation would involve
the use of the whole spectrum to produce a weighted value of stem:["d"Z//E] and also
a better assessment of stem:["d"eta] and the other variables.

=== Conclusions

Precise measurements of nuclides emitting low-energy radiations are possible
with an uncertainty of about 3% at the 95% confidence level. However
these measurements do rely upon models of light conversion in the scintillator
and a simple statistical approach based upon the Poisson distribution. By using
phototubes with a high gain (>30) at the first stage, such models are probably
adequate at this confidence level and the uncertainty could be reduced if the
approach proposed above is applied carefully. It is very important to emphasise
that extrapolation methods for radionuclides emitting low-energy radiations
cannot be justified theoretically. The fact that agreement is reached with other
independent methods is not a justification. Essentially, it is necessary to justify
theoretically each direct method independently, and then finally to make an
intercomparison in order to confirm that agreement to within the calculated
uncertainties has been achieved. In the case of the LS counter this justification
means a careful study of the system so as to produce the parameters for calculating
the pulse-height distribution and hence determine the counting efficiency. Full
justification and taking the method to its limits will need further research.

== The Use of Liquid Scintillators in Radionuclide Metrology

[align=center]
*R. Vatin footnote:[Laboratoire de Metrologie des Rayonnements lonisants, CEN Saclay, France.]*

=== Introduction

In the following pages we review the situation concerning the use of LS counting in
measuring radioactivity standards without, however, dealing with the problems
related to obtaining stable solutions, the phenomenon of adsorption and the
existence of multiple pulses, these questions being the subject of other parts of
this Monograph. Although a special study will be devoted to the statistical phenomena
involved in the detection process, we will deal briefly with the subject
of measuring radionuclides of the pure stem:[beta]-emission type.

We will examine the various problems raised in activity measurements of nuclides
decaying by pure stem:[beta]-particle emission, stem:[beta-gamma] emission, and those disintegrating by
electron capture without, however, seeking to provide an exhaustive list of
the published work. After describing the various characteristics of equipment
meeting metrological standards we will review the different methods used.

From the beginning of 1950 it appeared that it was possible to introduce small
quantities of a radionuclide into a fluorescent solution without destroying its
properties of luminous emission. This fact made it possible to envisage a new method
of measuring radioactivity, which, as a result of the intimate mixing of the radionuclide with the detecting medium, overcame the loss of efficiency in detection
caused by the absorption of part of the radiation by the solid source and its support
during measurements with a gas counter. This aspect appeared particularly interesting
in the measurement of the activity of radionuclides of the low-energy pure
stem:[beta]-particle emitters. However the values reported in the scientific literature at
that time showed very low detection efficiencies - only a few per cent in the case
of tritium. The method exhibited many inadequacies, low luminous output,
parasitic pulses, instability of the solutions, etc., and much work was necessary
to reach metrological levels.

=== Characteristics of metrology equipment

==== Experimental arrangement

. *The cell and collection of the light* - The object is to collect
the maximum of the light created by the scintillator. Various authors have used
one or more electron-multiplier phototubes. In arrangements using a single
phototube the cell, or vial, containing the scintillator is arranged vertically
above the photocathode of the phototube with an optical joint of silicone grease
and a reflecting or diffusing cover which directs the light towards the photocathode
<<ros54>>, <<rou55>>, <<ste56>>, <<fly59>>, <<sel60>>, <<bri61>>, <<van65>>, <<ihl67>>.
Amongst other advantages, the arrangement with two coaxial phototubes allows
better collection of the light. Many types of cells have been used with two phototubes.
The authors who use standard vials generally improve the collection of
the light by using a silicone bath or by a light duct with a silicone joint <<fly59>>,
<<sel60>>, <<bri61>>, <<van65>>, <<ihl67>>, <<rad71>>. Certain authors have used a sphere
in a silicone oil bath <<pal67>>. Others have employed glass cylindrical cells,
the axis of which coincides with that of the phototube <<aud58>>, <<ste67-2>>; see
also <<partIII-designs>>.
. *The electron-multiplier phototubes* - Much progress has been made in
the development of phototubes, particularly in the quantum efficiency which is
nearly 0.32 photoelectron per photon at 385 nm for a bialkali photocathode.
The photoelectron collection efficiency has also been improved by using highly
sophisticated electron optics. Dynodes activated with gall ium phosphide (GaP),
which are used in the first stage of certain recent phototubes (RCA 8850), have
a very high gain which can reach 40, and this has the effect of greatly reducing
fluctuations in low-amplitude pulses. Improved construction has also eliminated
ion build-up on the photocathode, so reducing one of the principal sources
of parasitic pulses footnote:[Sometimes called afterpulses or spurious pulses (see <<partVI>>.]. The new photocathodes, with increased sensitivity, have
a reduced dark current, and this means that it is no longer necessary to work
at low temperatures to achieve low levels of noise.

==== The scintillating solution

. *The solvent* - The solvent most widely used in lS metrology is still
toluene. For diluting inorganic salts in aqueous solution, as is the normal case
when measuring standards, ethanol or methanol are most frequently used as the
intermediate solvent. Dioxane is little used in metrology because of the chemiluminescence
that it exhibits when it comes into contact with water, as has been
pointed out by many authors, and also because of its lower luminous output.
Furthermore the standards to be measured generally have such high radioactivity
concentrations that it is possible to introduce only very small quantities of the
radioactive solution into the scintillator (less than 1%). Few authors carry out
systematic degassing of the solvent.

. *The scintillating solution* - Most laboratories still use the PPO-POPOP
system, even with the bialkaline photocathode. The reason for this
is that the properties of this scintillator are perfectly known, and that it
remains very effective even in the presence of quenching elements. Certain
workers use PBD or t-butyl-PBD. When measuring toluene labelled with ^14^C
or ^3^H it is advantageous to use BIBUQ <<kol70>>. Chemical formulae for these
and other scintillators are given in <<tableII-2>>.

. *Preparation of the sources* - Two source-preparation procedures are
possible. In certain laboratories a small aliquot of the active solution is placed
in each vial to be used in the measurement. Other authors prefer to dissolve
a larger aliquot in a large quantity of scintillator (50 to 100 cm^3^) and then
to fill the measuring vials with the ready-prepared solution. Obviously, the
measurement of the aliquots is carried out by weighing, usually by difference
weighing of a polythene pycnometer or using a cal ibrated micropipette <<ncr78>>.
The first method involves the measurement of small masses, usually a few milligrams,
the second procedure allows easier and more accurate weighing since the masses
are greater, generally of the order of a few hundred milligrams. Furthermore,
homogenisation of the active-solution - scintillator mixture is more easily
achieved in a flask of larger dimensions than the measuring cell. We should note
that the weighing of volatile solutions does present special difficulties <<gar65>>.

==== The counting electronics

At the present time charge-sensitive
preamplifiers using field-effect transistors completely solve the problem of
background noise in the amplification chain. Nevertheless care must be taken
not to allow saturation from pile-up in the preamplifier before the first differentiation.
In the same way transistor amplifiers are easily protected against overloads
so that there is no difficulty in working at very high gains and high-overload
levels in count-rate measurements, for example, of pure stem:[beta]-particle emitters.
Differentiating amplifiers with a single delay line with base-line restoration
give particularly good performance in this field. The discrimination and dead-time
circuits should be carefully chosen; for example, the dead time should be non-extending,
in order to reduce the dead-time correction uncertainty. No comment
needs to be made about scalers, except that provision be made for obtaining
the data in a form that is convenient for subsequent computer processing.
The electronic clock which controls the counting interval should, in general,
have an accuracy of 1 in 10^5^. When it is necessary to carry out extrapolation
as a function of the discriminator level it is possible, in the case of stem:[beta]-particle
emitters of reasonably high maximum energy, to repeat the measurements by
varying the discriminator voltage setting each time <<kol70>>, or by recording
count rates at several levels of discrimination simultaneously <<ste67-2>>, <<smi75-3>>.

==== Measurements using stem:[beta-gamma] coincidences

In the case where coincident
stem:[gamma] rays are detected many arrangements of the Nal(Tl) crystal or crystals are
possible <<aud58>>, <<bri61>>, <<van65>>, <<ihl67>>, <<pal67>>, <<ste67-2>>, <<rad71>>. In order to
obtain a high stem:[gamma]-ray efficiency it is possible to use Nal(Tl) crystals which completely
end ose the sample vial and the stem:[beta]-detecting phototube. The stem:[gamma]-channel amplifiers
are of the conventional type. The single-channel analyzer should be designed
to give precise time information and to impose a well-defined dead time so as
to make exact corrections possible.

=== The methods

==== Measuring radionuclides which disintegrate by pure stem:[beta]-particle emission

The stem:[beta]-ray spectra show a non-zero emission probability density down
to and including zero energy. Part of the spectrum is situated in the region of
the background noise of the detector and the amplifier. It is therefore necessary
to have recourse to extrapolation of the rate of integral counting to zero value
of the energy. The shapes of the stem:[beta]-ray spectra are very different, and the detection
procedure considerably modifies them. For those of high maximum energy it is
possible <<rou55>>, <<ste56>>, <<fly59>>, <<sel60>>, <<bri61>>, <<van65>>, using adequate
amplification, to obtain a flat region of the spectrum; this justifies linear extrapolation,
although no theoretical reason can be advanced to explain this fact.
Many workers have also observed a build-up of the differential spectrum towards
the lower energies without being able to attribute this to the background noise
of the amplifier or the detector background <<wel52>>, <<ros54>>, <<rou55>>. This phenomenon,
attributed to multiple pulses arising from the detector or the amplifier,
can be eliminated by a dead-time circuit preceding the counting scaler <<wel52>>,
<<rou55>>.

Comparison of these results with those obtained by other methods shows, in the case
of radionuclides of maximum energy lower than 200 keV, a detection efficiency
which is less than 100% <<hay53>>, <<hor58>>, <<gol65>> (^14^C, ^35^S, ^63^Ni, ^106^Ru,
^241^Pu and, in particular, ^3^H). This is attributed to statistical fluctuations in the
number of photoelectrons emitted by the cathode of the phototube, and the non-vanishing
probability that a low-energy event results in no photoelectron being
emitted (see <<partIV>>.

Basing his work on the hypothesis of the Poisson distribution of the electronic
emission of the photocathode Wright <<wri54>> calculated the zero-detection probability
(ZDP) In the case of monoenergetic ionising particles. Tissen <<tis58>>
extended this calculation to continuous stem:[beta]-ray spectra in the cases of detection
by a single phototube, and by two phototubes in coincidence. He characterized
the quality of the detection assembly - scintillator and photocathode - by the mean
number of photoelectrons obtained for unit loss of energy of the primary particle
in the scintillator, and showed that, approximating to the allowed form of the
decay of radionuclides of low atomic number, and on the hypothesis of linear
response of the scintillator, the efficiency of detection depends only on the quality
parameter and the maximum energy of the continuous spectrum. Values calculated
in this way for ^3^H and ^14^C are found to be in good agreement with current experimental results.

Horrocks and Studier <<hor61>> showed that, for a given spectrum, the ratio of the
detection efficiencies with a single phototube and two in coincidence depends
only on the quality parameter (figure of merit). They obtained excellent agreement
between their experimental measurements and theoretical values calculated on
the basis of an average of one photoelectron per 1.5 keV of energy dissipated
in the scintillator.

The high ionization densities created by low-energy electrons reduce the luminous
output of organic scintillators. This results in a non-linear response for energies
less than about 100 keV. Birks <<bir51>> has given a formula describing the phenomenon
where the luminous output varies with the loss of specific energy of the
particle. In their article Gibson and Gale <<gib68>> take this effect into account
by the introduction of a term dependent on the energy, stem:[Q(E)], when calculating
the detection efficiency (see <<partIV>>. According to them the uncertainty in
respect to the coefficients does not introduce an error of more than 3% in the
value of stem:[Q(E)] for an energy of 5 keV. The quality parameter measured on their
installation is 0.45 photoelectron/keV. From this they deduce a detection efficiency
with a single phototube of 62.9% for ^3^H and, by comparison with
a Radiochemical Centre standard, they observe a difference of - 2.4%. With
the phototubes in coincidence, they calculate an efficiency of 43% with
a difference, in respect to an NBS standard, of +2.7%. For ^14^C the calculated
values are 96.4% and 93.7%, respectively (1971 revised values) <<gib71-1>>,
with differences of +3.5% and +2.5% in respect of the standards.

These calculations assume that the quality parameter is known. In the method
of Kolarov et al. <<kol70>> the quality parameter is determined at the time of the
measurement itself by solving the system of non-linear equations which link the
efficiency of detection in coincidence, summed and for each phototube separately,
with the experimental count rates. In these equations the quality parameter occurs
as an unknown in the same way as the activity. When applied to ^3^H this method
gives differences of about 4% in excess when compared with an NBS standard
(unpublished results).

The accuracy of all these methods obviously depends on the accuracy of the
theories and of the values of the parameters occurring in them, since they all lead
to an a priori calculation of the detection efficiencies. The principal sources of
systematic error are due to the theory of the energy loss of the electrons in matter
(Bethe), to the theory of ionization quenching (Birks, Voltz), to the theory of the
form of spectra (Fermi), and to the calculation of the deformation of the spectra
by wall effects.

Let us examine these various points:

. The Bethe formula is not very accurate and is almost certainly inaccurate
below 0.5 keV for organic solvents. This results in an error which is difficult to
quantify but which is certainly less than 0.1% in the case of ^14^C. At the present
time there is no accurate theory in this field of energy <<fan64>>.
. Two different theories <<bir51>>, <<fan64>>, <<vol65>>, <<gib68>>, <<gib71-1>> giving
numerically very similar results make it possible to calculate the yield of organic
scintillators <<ste67-1>>, <<hor71-1>>. Gibson <<gib68>> has estimated that the uncertainty
in respect of the coefficient in the Birks formula was likely to introduce an error
of stem:[+- 2%] in the detection efficiency in the case of ^3^H, but less than 0.1%
in the case of ^14^C. Experimental determination of the luminous response of
organic scintillators <<hor64-2>> is inaccurate, particularly below 20 keV. There
are, in fact, few references to energies in this range and, furthermore, resolution
of the peaks is poor.
. A formula due to Benjamin <<ben62>> has been used up to the present time
to take account of the wall effect. Actually, this only gives the proportion of
particles which encounter the wall. It is however preferable to calculate precisely
the deformed spectrum. The method of Snidov and Warren <<sni67>> can be used.
This effect is considerable in the case of high-energy emitters, since it causes
the appearance of a large number of small pulses for which the zero-detection
probability is considerable.
. The exact form of the stem:[beta]-ray spectra themselves is not always well known.
Only rarely does theory make it possible to forecast the nature of the transition,
and few factors relating to the experimental shape have been published. Furthermore
theoreticians have introduced new correction terms (radiative, polarization,
etc.) <<kin59>>, <<kal67>>, <<wil70>>, the practical calculation of which has been found
to be difficult.

*Methods not requiring a priori calculations* - The guiding idea here is
to make the non-detection probability increase and to carry out extrapolation
for a zero non-detection probability. Several procedures are possible: inhibition
of the luminescence of the scintillator, modification of the optical coupling by
interposing optical absorbing filters <<fly71>>, defocussing of the phototube <<gib71-2>>.
It is enough to know simply the attenuation ratios, and this can easily be achieved
by using an external stem:[gamma]-ray source or, better, using an internal monoenergetic
source (e.g. of conversion electrons or stem:[alpha] particles). The only source of systematic
error is then the uncertainty of the extrapolation. In the communication already
cited, Flynn and his co-authors carry out a linear extrapolation. They estimate
their maximum error as stem:[+-2%] for ^3^H. It should be possible to improve the method
by increasing the number of points, and this is easily done by defocussing and by
carrying out a non-linear extrapolation.

==== Measurements on stem:[beta-gamma] emitters

In the method of activity measurement
using stem:[beta-gamma] coincidences it is very advantageous if at least one of the detectors
has a high detection efficiency. Detectors using liquid scintillators for the detection
of stem:[beta] radiation satisfactorily meet this condition, but in addition to this the intimate
mixing of the radionuclide and the scintillator means that the sensitivity is more
or less constant throughout the whole volume of the source (if there is no adsorption
at the boundaries), this property also being very favorable to the quality of
measuring by coincidence.

The elementary theory of the method of stem:[beta-gamma] coincidences assumes that the detectors
have zero detection efficiency for the type of radiation for which they are not
intended.

This is only true as a first approximation, particularly for the stem:[beta] detector.
Whilst for a proportional counter this sensitivity stem:[epsilon_(beta_gamma)] is several parts in
a thousand, it reaches several percent and varies with the level of filling
of the cell in an LS counter. Under these conditions it is preferable to use
an extrapolation method <<hor76-1>>. However with a liquid scintillator, which
preserves the general form of the stem:[beta]-ray spectrum reasonably well, one can easily
make the efficiency of detection vary by simple modification of the counting
threshold. For the same reasons the method is equally suitable for measuring
the activities of emitters with a complex decay scheme <<hou62>>, <<bae66>>.

It has been shown that the method of extrapolation in coincidence involves
an error if certain conditions are not satisfied <<wil64>>, <<wil67>>, <<bae67>>, <<wil68>>.
The systematic error arises from the difference in the forms of the spectra of the
various stem:[beta] branches, from the lack of homogeneity of the source, and the escape of part
of the radiation. Obviously this error becomes smaller as the detection efficiencies
which are achieved become greater. With LS the detection efficiency is greater
than 95% for stem:[beta] radiation of energy greater than about 5 keV, and this is a very
distinct advantage when compared with measurements with counters using a solid
source. One way of detecting the systematic error in extrapolation is to repeat
the measurement with different stem:[gamma]-ray gates <<bae67>>. Spahr and Binkert <<spa71>>
have recently reported results on measuring ^134^Cs with different stem:[gamma]-ray gates:
stem:[gamma_9] (1 365 keV) in coincidence with stem:[beta]'s of lower energy, stem:[gamma_5] (796 keV) in coincidence
with stem:[beta]'s of high energy. They obtained in these cases extrapolated values
0.04% higher and 0.33% lower in relation to the value found with stem:[gamma_4]
(604.7 keV), in coincidence with three stem:[beta] branches. The same authors have carried
out a comparison of the results obtained with a proportional counter and with a
liquid scintillator in the case of ^60^Co. They found a deviation of 0.14% lower
with the liquid scintillator, their statistical accuracy being 0.14% (the confidence
interval is not given). For more details on ^134^Cs measurements, the reader may
consult <<partVII>> and <<ryt80>>.

It is necessary in all these very important questions to pursue, in a systematic
manner, the theoretical and experimental study of the accuracy of the methods
obtained by the extrapolation method.

[[measurement_pure_beta_particle]]
==== Measurement of pure stem:[beta]-particle emitters with a stem:[beta-gamma] tracer

The method of stem:[beta-gamma] tracing previously used in the assay of pure stem:[beta]-particle emitters
with proportional counters <<cam59>>, <<cam60>>, <<bae64>> has subsequently been used
with a LS detector <<ste63>>. This can, in fact, be regarded as a variant of the
method for measuring stem:[beta-gamma] emitters with a complex decay scheme, and the general
theory <<bae66>> can be fully applied. LS detectors allow good mixing of the two
radionuclides and high homogeneity of the source. As a result they are not subject
to the principal cause of systematic error in detectors with a solid source. Extrapolation
can conveniently be carried out by variation of the counting threshold.
The systematic error arising from the difference in the stem:[beta] spectra still, obviously,
continues to exist. It can be detected and estimated by repeating the measurement
with different stem:[beta-gamma] tracers. In this way Spahr and Binkert <<spa71>> have assayed
^35^S using ^60^Co, ^134^Cs and ^203^Hg as tracers. Their results expressed as ratios
to the result obtained with ^134^Cs (stem:[gamma]-ray gate unspecified) were

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
1.0039 +- 0.0012" with "^(60)"Co"
++++

and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
0.9989 +- 0.0012" with "^(203)"Hg".
++++

It can be seen that the difference between these ratios (0.50%) is higher than
the random errors in the ratios. It is interesting to note that, in a measurement
of ^35^S by tracers with a proportional counter, Williams and Goodier <<wil67>>
found a larger difference in the opposite direction.

The complementarity of these two methods can be clearly seen, and it is reasonable
to assume that systematic comparisons would make it possible to detect and reduce
the errors.

An accurate extrapolation could be made if it were known how the ratio of the
counting efficiencies for the two radionuclides varied as the counting threshold
is varied. A novel solution to this problem was developed by Bryant et al. <<bry67>>,
<<jon70>> in which an opto-mechanical device simulated the scintillations produced
by stem:[beta] particles in the scintillator taking into account the theoretical stem:[beta] spectra and
the variation of scintillator efficiency with stem:[beta]-particle energy. Tests showed that
this system accurately reproduced the shapes of known efficiency functions. A modification
of this method in which the opto-mechanical device has been replaced
by a computer simulation is routinely used for the standardization of pure stem:[beta]-particle
emitters <<mcn80>>.

==== Measurement of radionuclides disintegrating by electron capture

In a liquid scintillator the Auger electrons are detected with high efficiency and
good reproducibility <<ste67-2>>. X rays of low energy have a short path in the
liquid scintiilator, and escape is not of great importance with the volumes of
scintillator normally used (a few milliliters). Cascades of X and Auger events
make it possible to collect all the energy of the vacancy created by a capture.
All these reasons lead to high detection efficiency - 80% for ^54^Mn - for radio-nuclides which disintegrate by electron capture.

Steyn <<ste67-1>> has applied the extrapolation method in coincidence to the
measurement of the activity of emitters which disintegrate by electron capture
followed by stem:[gamma] emission. In this way he measured ^51^Cr, ^54^Mn, ^65^Zn and ^57^Co
with small differences with respect to measurements made with a proportional
counter, except for ^51^Cr where he observed a difference of -2.8%. The
maximum efficiency obtained with ^57^Co was (stem:[89.1 +- 0.1])% with the liquid
scintillator, whilst it varied from 39% to 62% according to the sources when
using a proportional counter. This high reproducibility of liquid-scintillator
efficiency makes it possible to envisage the measurement of radionuclides which
disintegrate by electron capture without stem:[gamma]-ray emission, the detection efficiency
being known by interpolation of the efficiencies obtained with other radionuclides
(it must obviously be assumed that the quenching remains small). With radionuclides
of high atomic number, that part of the efficiency resulting from the escape of part
of the X radiation constitutes a geometrical effect which may involve a systematic
error in the extrapolation by variation of the counting threshold <<wil68>>.

One can therefore envisage the measurement of emitters disintegrating by pure
electron capture by using, as the tracer, a radionuclide which disintegrates with
electron capture followed by stem:[gamma]-ray emission. If the atomic numbers of the two
elements do not differ greatly, the method of extrapolation should not introduce
an excessive error.

If the electron capture is in competition with positron emission the situation
becomes more complex. A report dealing with this subject is by Steyn and
de Jesus <<ste66>> who, however, used a plastic instead of a liquid scintillator.

==== Measurement of stem:[alpha] emitters

The resolution of stem:[alpha]-particle spectra
obtained by LS systems is of the order of 20 to 30% (in terms of full width of
the peak at half maximum divided by stem:[alpha]-particle energy). This dispersion arises
from the location of light emission in the scintillator, rather than from statistical
fluctuations in the number of photoelectrons in the phototube. The boundary effect
results in the formation of a "tail" between the peak and zero energy. This tail
normally represents less than 1% of all the pulses. Therefore, under these conditions,
together with low-noise electronics, the only source of error being that
inherent in the extrapolation, it is possible to obtain high accuracy. Ihle <<ihl67>>
has shown that underlight-collecting conditions which had deliberately been
made poor, the resultant error remains small (stem:[~~0.1%]).

=== Conclusion

As a result of many improvements, mainly in electron-multiplier phototubes,
liquid-scintillator detectors have become an effective and reliable method for
measuring activity in the preparation of radioactivity standards. They now offer
an attractive alternative to detectors using gas multiplication. Their intrinsic
properties of homogeneity and sensitivity make it possible to achieve low systematic
errors, and it cannot be doubted that increasing recourse will be made to them
in the metrology of radioactivity standards.

For the measurement of pure stem:[beta]-particle emitters, with the exception of certain
difficult cases, the accuracy is a few parts in a thousand. The method of extrapolation,
which is very easy with a liquid scintillator, only gives differences
of the order of one part in a thousand between the values obtained with different
stem:[gamma]-ray gates. These detectors are also very advantageous when measuring emitters
which decay by electron capture. Systematic study, both theoretical and experimental,
wold make it possible to reduce still further the uncertainties in
measurement.

== The Problem of Afterpulses

[align=center]
*D. Smith footnote:[Division of Radiation Science and Acoustics, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK.]*

=== Introduction

This part on the subject of afterpulses is principally a review of the literature,
but also incorporates and describes experimental work carried out at the
National Physical Laboratory (NPL), including some quantitative afterpulse
measurements under conditions appropriate to radioactivity standardisation.

[[afterpulses]]
=== Afterpulses in electron-multiplier phototubes

Considerable work was done in the early 1950's <<god51>>, <<lan52>>, <<mue52>>, <<sci52>>,
<<har54>>, <<mey54>>, <<bre55>>, <<rou55>> on afterpulsing in electron-multiplier phototubes,
but since that time fabrication techniques have greatly reduced afterpulses from
most phototubes. This, together with the fact that the presence of a slow component
in liquid-scintillator emission <<bir64-1>> was not recognised, casts doubt on the
relevance of much of the early work to modern phototubes.

The useful gain of a phototube is limited by feedback processes, mainly optical
and ionic, which create afterpulses, although even in normal operation well
below this limit, such effects do give rise to spurious pulses following the main pulse.

Typical afterpulse distributions are shown in <<figVI-1>> and <<figVI-2>>, taken at
NPL with a Philips 56 DUVP and an RCA 31000D tube. Similar curves were
obtained by White <<whi67>>, Delaney <<del67>> and Shin <<shi68>>. The distributions
shown were taken with a time-to-amplitude converter and found to be the same
in this time region, irrespective of whether the main pulse is produced by a radioactive
source in a scintillator or by a gallium-phosphide nanosecond light pulser.
Morton <<mor67>> found that in modern tubes, most afterpulses in the region below
one microsecond are due to the ionisation of gas molecules in the volume between
the cathode and first dynode; the positive ions so formed strike the cathode and
cause the release of secondary electrons.

The sharpness of the peaks in the afterpulse distribution below stem:[1" "mu rm(s)] has been
shown to be due to a combination of the effect of the isochronous transit time
<<mor67>> for the ions in the cathode-first-dynode space, irrespective of their
exact point of origin, and the effect of the variation, with energy, of the
coliision cross section for ionisation by electrons <<coa71>>. Kuchnir <<kuc68>>
found that tubes especially aged by RCA showed a marked reduction in this type
of afterpulsing.

By connecting phototubes to a gas-handling system, Morton <<mor67>> verified
that the early afterpulses were due to gaseous ions and that the H~2~ ^\+^ion, possibly
the result of water vapour being absorbed before sealing, is responsible for the
prompt afterpulse (at about stem:[0.3" "mu rm(s)] at typical voltages) which is observed in
most tubes. Some gases caused afterpulses equivalent in amplitude to only a single
photoelectron, and it is interesting to note that oxygen apparently produced
no afterpulses. Shin <<shi68>> also observed afterpulses in the region below stem:[1" "mu rm(s)]
from a 58 AVP and 60 AVP tube, ascribing the various peaks to H~2~ ^+^ions and
other residual gases. White <<whi67>>, using a focussing-type phototube, observed
afterpulses at 0.8 and stem:[4" "mu rm(s)], following single photoelectron events, and suggested
they may be due to the movement of ions from an early dynode.

Staubert <<sta70>> observed afterpulses in 53 AVP, 54 AVP and EMI 9583B tubes,
up to stem:[15" "mu rm(s)] after the main pulse, with an intensity correlated to the main pulse,
although an RCA 6810A tube was claimed not to show any afterpulses.

The cathode can be an important element in the process of forming afterpulses.
Morton <<mor67>> found that tubes with cathodes containing caesium or potassium
all exhibited afterpulses, but that a baryum cathode did not for any residual gas
composition.

Morton <<mor67>> found that for single photoelectron events, an afterpulse was
equivalent, on average, to four photoelectrons (for a caesium-containing cathode),
although Delaney <<del67>> using a venetian-blind-type tube, found afterpulses
only occurred for main pulses greater than about three photoelectrons. At NPL,
using a 56 AVP, 56 DUVP and RCA 31000D tubes, it was observed that the probability
of afterpulsing was very dependent on the main pulse height, and to a lesser
extent, on pulse width. Further, by using a light pulser, a gating system and
a variable discriminator, it was found that if any region (above about stem:[1" "mu rm(s)]) of
the afterpulse time distribution was selected, then the general shape (but not the
intensity) of the afterpulse amplitude distribution within that selected region
did not change significantly with main pulse height over the range from one photoelectron
up to many photoelectrons. The majority of afterpulses was equivalent
in size to one photoelectron, but there were also many larger afterpulses, and
above about four photoelectrons the probability of afterpulsing decreased only
linearly with afterpulse amplitude, so that large-amplitude afterpulses are quite
possible.

Krall <<kra67>> studied extraneous light emission from phototubes, and at high
amplification (> 10^9^) an electrode glow due to electron bombardment of the later
dynodes was found, which occurred about 40 and 80 ns after the main pulse.
In a single-phototube counting system this is inconsequential, due to the normal
dead times employed, but in coincidence counting, this light could activate
an adjacent phototube to give a spurious coincidence, although most modern tubes
have optical baffles and a constriction in the envelope near the cathode which
minimises this effect. Normally however, phototubes are operated at lower gains
where this effect is absent, but there is some evidence <<kra67>> that light is produced
by the recombination radiation of the residual gas ions formed in the manner
described by Morton <<mor67>>, which could also cause spurious coincidences
in a two-phototube set-up. Electroluminescence of the tube envelope <<kra67>>
is also a possible source of extraneous light which is, however, normally avoided
with positive high-voltage supplies, whereby the faceplate region is near ground
potential.

=== The effect of stem:[gamma] rays on electron-multiplier phototubes

Work by Jerde <<jer67>> and Dressier <<dre67>> has indicated that high-energy radiation
incident upon a phototube can produce pulses of two types. Jerde observed that
a stem:[gamma] ray from the decay of ^60^Co, passing through the faceplate on an RCA 7265
phototube, produced one large pulse with an amplitude equivalent to about ten
photoelectrons, along with about ten afterpulses. Similar studies by Dressier on
EMR phototubes recorded afterpulses decaying with a lifetime of up to 2 ms and
from one to three afterpulses per main pulse with bialkali or Sb-Cs cathodes with
glass faceplates. The main pulse can be explained by the Čerenkov radiation
from the Compton-scattered electrons, or for low-energy stem:[gamma] rays, by the production
of visible photons in the glass by fluorescence or scintillation <<joh70>>. For the
afterpulses Jerde suggests that phosphorescence in the glass could be excited
by ultra-violet photons produced by the Čerenkov radiation, although later work
by Dressier casts doubt on this and suggests that the afterpulses are due to direct
excitation of electrons in the sol id. The work indicated that afterpulsing increased
with stem:[gamma]-ray energy, suggesting a correlation between the afterpulse and the energy
of the recoil electron.

At NPL the effect of stem:[gamma] rays from the decay of ^60^Co on an RCA 31000D phototube
has been measured. A liquid-scintillator bottle containing ^60^Co, enclosed in
aluminium foil, did produce numerous afterpulses in the millisecond region, but
only at discrimination levels below those normally used for counting purposes.

=== The decay of excited liquid scintillation

Dupont <<dup67>> studied the luminescence decay curves of organic scintillators,
excited by ^60^Co, and observed a slow component of order stem:[0.1" "mu rm(s)] for toluene
or phenylcyclohexane solvents with TP, PBD or PPD solutes footnote:[The chemical names of these fluors are given in <<partII>> of this Monograph.] and found that the
presence of dissolved oxygen greatly reduced the strength and probably the lifetime
of this component. Using a ^137^Cs or ^65^Zn stem:[gamma]-ray source to excite Nuclear Enterprises
liquid scintillators, Kuchnir <<kuc68>> observed slow components of order stem:[0.5" "mu rm(s)],
after taking into account the effect of phototube afterpulses in this region. Early
work by Harrison <<har54>> using X-ray excitation, which showed the slow components
to be negligible, was in error presumably as the scintillators contained dissolved
oxygen. Vaninbroukx <<van65>> observed small afterpulses many minutes after
irradiation of a phototube and glass sample vial with stem:[gamma] rays from the decay of ^60^Co,
and pointed out that these small pulses are probably due to phosphorescence and
hence consist principally of single-photon events. Therefore a coincidence method
would eliminate them, and, in a single phototube, the discriminator level should
be so low as to include such single-photon events. Similar experiments at NPL
with an RCA 31000D tube confirmed that there was negligible << 0.1%) long-term
stem:[gamma]-ray-induced phosphorescence (stem:[tau < 30 rm(s)]) at discrimination levels equivalent
to one photoelectron.

With electron excitation, Owen <<owe59>> observed a slow component in oxygen-free
liquid scintillators with a time constant of the order of stem:[1" "mu rm(s)], and Horrocks
<<hor70-1>> gives time constants of about stem:[0.25" "mu rm(s)]. The relative intensities of the
fast and slow components differ for different types of particle and is, of course,
the basis of pulse-shape discrimination techniques <<wri56>>, <<owe58>>, <<dac61>>.

The prompt emission, whether excited by particles or stem:[gamma] rays is due to emission
from primary singlet states formed by direct interaction with the ionising particle
<<bir64-2>>, <<hor70-1>>. The slow emission is currently explained <<bir64-1>>, <<dup67>>,
<<hor70-1>> as being due to a delayed emission from singlet states which result from
triplet-triplet interaction between molecule pairs. This mechanism was proposed
in 1961 <<par61>>, and expanded by King and Voltz <<kin66>>. Previous theories
which have been abandoned include slow ion-electron recombination <<bro59>>,
<<buc60>>, long-lived higher excited triplet states <<bir60>> and the formation of pairs
of excited molecules which had long lifetimes <<gib62>>.

The shape of the slow decay component is complex and is not described by a simple
decay law. However in normal scintillation counting their intensity is small
<<bir64-1>> (stem:[<= 0.1%] that of the main pulse after stem:[1" "mu rm(s)]) and they can be avoided
by employing suitable dead times.

=== Phosphorescence problems

Electron-multiplier phototubes show long-term phosphorescence after exposure
to daylight at ultra-violet light <<kra67>> and liquid scintillators or glass containers
can fluoresce for days after exposure <<dav57>>, <<llo62>>, <<van65>>. Thus all containers
and liquids must be handled in darkness or in red light. Chemiluminescence is often
associated with biological material and solubilizers and in particular with dioxanebased
scintillators <<bra70-1>>, <<kea71>>, although this is of little importance for
standardisation purposes where simpler chemical forms of radioactive material can
be chosen.

Because the emission of luminescent light is in the form of single uncorrelated
photons, coincidence systems will not be affected, and in a single tube system
the discriminator level would eliminate most pulses of this type. Fodor-Csanyi
et al. <<fod68>>, <<fod69>> recently observed such phosphorescence and suggested
that many early authors attributed non-linear bias curves erroneously to phototube
afterpulses.

=== Some quantitative measurements of afterpulses

The degree of afterpulsing occurring in a LS standardisation of ^60^Co, employing
an RCA 31000D phototube (which has a GaP first dynode) and a toluene-PPO-POPOP footnote:[The chemical names are given in <<partII>> of this Monograph.]
scintillator, has been quantitatively measured at NPL. Much of this work,
including its mathematical basis, has been published <<lew73>>, <<wil73>>, <<bip76>>.

In the region below stem:[100" "mu rm(s)], the degree of afterpulsing can be readily observed
by variation of the dead time, and such experiments at NPL indicate that a dead
time of at least stem:[10" "mu rm(s)] is required to reduce these spurious pulses to well below
the 0.1% level, even with an electronic threshold (or "discriminator level")
corresponding to modest stem:[beta]-counting efficiencies (say 75% for ^60^Co).

In the stem:[10" "mu rm(s)] to stem:[100" "rm(ms)] range a correlation technique <<gol55>> has been used
<<lew73>>, <<wil73>> to measure the deviations from Poisson statistics in the stem:[beta] channel,
in conjunction with the stem:[4pi beta-gamma] coincidence method. In this technique, the number
of stem:[beta] pulses occurring in a fixed time interval is repeatedly counted, and any
difference between the resulting variance and mean of the number in this interval
is quantitatively related to the fractional number of afterpulses in that interval.
The fraction of afterpulses observed as a function of this sampling time interval at
a discriminator level corresponding to a stem:[beta]-counting efficiency of 96.5% for
^60^Co, is shown in <<figVI-3>>. This shows that most spurious pulses occur within
about stem:[10" "rm(ms)] of the main pulse. <<figVI-4>> shows the stem:[beta]-particle count rate as
a function of counting efficiency, stem:[epsilon_beta], both with and without this correction for
afterpulsing. The deviation from linearity of the corrected curve at the higher
efficiencies is mainly due to a fraction of the main pulses being followed by more
than one afterpulse.

Afterpulses with lifetimes greater than stem:[100" " rm(ms)] could also occur, but since NPL
comparisons of absolute standardisation of ^46^Sc, ^51^Cr, ^60^Co, ^86^Rb, ^95^Nb, ^123^I,
^134^Cs, ^139^Ce by stem:[4pi beta("LS")-gamma] and stem:[4pi beta("PC")-gamma] methods have shown agreement to
within 0.2%, they would appear to be negligible.

.Observed stem:[beta]-count rate as a function of measured stem:[beta]-counting efficiency, with and without the correction for afterpulsing.
image::img30.png[]

As noted in <<afterpulses>>, the probability of afterpulsing increases with increasing pulse
height, so it is to be expected that for stem:[beta] emitters, the larger the end-point energy
of the nuclide, the larger the problem of afterpulsing becomes. Indeed, it is found
that for stem:[beta-gamma] emitters with one predominant stem:[beta] branch, the energy threshold of discrimination
required to reduce afterpulsing to below say 0.1%, is roughly proportional
to the end-point energy, at least for end-point energies above about 300 keV
(which corresponds to a discriminator level in the region of 10 keV). The discriminator
level can rarely be reduced much below that corresponding to 10 keV,
because to do so would include some pulses corresponding to single photoelectrons,
a region in which the probability of afterpulsing is particularly high.

It should be noted that the degree of afterpulsing in two nominally identical
phototubes con be significantly different, and also that a slight reduction in the
degree of afterpulsing can often be achieved by considerably reducing the cathode-first-dynode voltage below that sometimes recommended, and increasing the
amplification elsewhere to compensate.

=== Conclusion

Although afterpulses arise in electron-multiplier phototubes, and from scintillators
and containers, and limit the operating conditions for LS counting, it appears
from the above evidence that with modern phototubes, and with readily attainable
conditions, afterpulses can be kept below the 0.1% level, at least for medium
stem:[beta]-particle energies. Therefore a liquid scintillator should be a feasible sybstitute
for the proportional counter for the metrology of stem:[beta]-particle-emitting nuclides,
as far as the problem of afterpulses is concerned.

== Intercomparison of ^134^Cs by Liquid-Scintillation Counting
=== Introduction

Following the initial draft of this review of the present position in LS counting,
the members of a BIPM working party agreed to arrange an international comparison
of measurements of the activity of a solution of ^134^Cs, using the method
of stem:[4pi beta] (liquid scintillator)-stem:[gamma] efficiency variation. The NPL agreed to act as
co-ordinator and provide the ampoules containing the activity. Measurements
were carried out by LMRI, NAC, NBS and NPL early in 1977.

[[figVII-1]]
.Decay scheme for ^134^Cs.

Gamma-ray spectrometry demonstrated that there was less than 0.1% ^137^Cs
impurity present in the solution. No other stem:[gamma]-ray-emitting impurities were reported.

Cesium-134 nuclear-decay data from the Oak Ridge Evaluated Nuclear Structure

=== Results

Each laboratory took measurements with several different stem:[gamma]-ray windows corresponding
to various photopeaks in the spectrum, and two laboratories also took
integral measurements above a stem:[gamma]-ray-energy threshold of 500 keV. The usual
technique of stem:[beta]-particle detection-efficiency extrapolation <<bae73>> was used for
each window, i.e. if the count rates per unit mass (s^-l^ mg^-1^, corrected for dead-time
losses, half lives, background, etc.) are stem:[N_beta], stem:[N_gamma] and stem:[N_c], then

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_beta // epsilon_beta = N_0 + alpha_1(1- epsilon_beta) // epsilon_beta + alpha_2 (1-epsilon_beta)^2 // epsilon_beta^2 + ...,
++++

where stem:[epsilon_beta = N_c // N_gamma], and hence the disintegration rate stem:[N_0] is the extrapolated
value of stem:[N_beta // epsilon_beta] at stem:[epsilon_beta = 1].

The degree of fit required was usually quadratic, although the actual values of
the coefficients stem:[alpha_1] and stem:[alpha_2] obtained for a particular stem:[gamma]-ray window varied greatly
from one participant to another, being dependent on the particular apparatus and
the exact range of stem:[gamma]-ray energies selected.

The values of stem:[N_0] (on 1977-02-01, 00 h UT) with the range of stem:[beta]-detection efficiencies
measured for each stem:[gamma]-ray window are quoted in <<tableVII-3>> and shown
graphically in <<figVII-2>>.

=== Conclusion

All the quoted results for stem:[N_0] by LS counting are self-consistent within the quoted
uncertainties, and are in good agreement with stem:[N_0] obtained by stem:[4pi beta("PC")-gamma]
techniques. The overall spread of 0.50% is comparable with the spread observed
in, for example, the recent ^139^Ce international comparison <<ryt77>>.
