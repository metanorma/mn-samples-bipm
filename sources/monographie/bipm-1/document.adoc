.Preface

This monograph is one of several to be published by the Bureau International
des Poids et Mesures (B.I.P.M.) on behalf of the Comité Consultotif pour
les Etalons de Mesure des Rayonnements Ionisants (C.C.E.M.R.I.). The
aim of this series of publications is to review various topics which are of
importance for the measurement of ionizing radiation and radioactivity,
in particular, those techniques normally used by participants in international
comparisons. It is hoped that these publications will prove to be useful
reference volumes both for those who are already engaged in this field and
for those who are approaching such measurements for the first time.

This volume is concerned with a particular aspect of radionuclide metrology
and was prepared for publication by P.J. Campion.

== Introduction

Advances in metrology are usually made by concentrating on the reduction
of the magnitude of the most significant source of potential error in a
measurement to a value which is small compared with those of other sources;
the process is then repeated with the next most significant source and so on.
Thus, a particular technique which may be good enough within a measuring
system which is capable of an accuracy of, say, stem:[\+- 2%] may not be acceptable
when all the other techniques in that system have been improved to a level
of accuracy of stem:[+- 0.2%]. Hence techniques and procedures, which may be
found satisfactory at a given time, must be examined periodically in the
light of advances made in the rest of the system. With the present state-of-the-art of radioactivity metrology the two stages in the determination
of radioactive concentration where errors are perhaps most likely to occur
(apart from the disintegration rate measurement of the individual sources)
are (1) the dilution of a concentrated solution and (2) the dispensing of
small quantities of the diluted solution in the preparation of sources for
counting. Techniques for the satisfactory accomplishment of both these
manipulations have been described in the literature although a considerable
amount of additional and detailed knowledge remains unpublished and is
vested in many laboratories throughout the world. This monograph represents
an attempt to provide a guide to what might be called "good laboratory
practice" in this area. Because not all laboratories agree on the best practice
at every point, an attempt has been made to record variant procedures where
these have been made known to the author. It follows, therefore, that while
generally agreeing with this report, all the members of C.C.E.M.R.I. do not
necessarily subscribe to all of its recommendations. It is hoped that the
monograph will be of value to those engaged in the standardization of
radioactivity, especially those who may be approaching these problems for
the first time.

== General Requirements for Weighing

It is generally agreed that diluting and dispensing are best carried out
gravimetrically and hence the first requirement is a balance capable of
determining the mass of a liquid drop in the range 10 to 100 mg to an
accuracy of better than stem:[\+- 20" "mu"g"]. Such balances are often limited in their
capacity and it is thus convenient to have a second balance on which masses
of the order of 50 g can be weighed and which need only have on accuracy
of about stem:[+- 200" "mu"g"]. It is important that the balances should be located in
a room that is relatively drought-free and which should be large enough
to carry out simple manipulations other than weighing. Mechanical
balances in particular should rest on a rigid and heavy table, preferably
on the bottom floor of a building , the floor being in contact with
compacted or undisturbed ground. Alternatively the table should rest on
brick or concrete piers with foundations in undisturbed ground. It is also
important that balances should be regularly cleaned and serviced. A small
thermal gradient of the order of stem:[0.1" K m"^(-1)] within the balance enclosure
(top warmer) is essential for the stability of equal-arm type of balances,
but due to basic differences in design, it is not usually necessary to impose
such a gradient within the enclosure of single-arm balances <<macurdy>>; it is good
laboratory practice to locate the balances in a part of the balance room
that has a positive thermal gradient (top warmer) because the general nature
of the disturbing effects of having the top cooler is applicable to some
degree to all types of precise balances. The temperature in the balance
room should be both spatially uniform and constant preferably to within stem:[\+- 0.50 °C]
over a short period, say one hour, and to within stem:[+- 1 °C] over a 24 hour period.
The humidity should also be reasonably constant over the same
period, say with in stem:[+- 5%] at a relative humidity preferably in the range 50
to 60%. Such stability may be achieved by careful location of the balance
room (e.g. a room within a room, or a room with a very large thermal
capacity) or by suitable air conditioning equipment. In the latter case it is
particularly important to ensure that any vibration of the air conditioning
plant is not transmitted to the balance room. It is also desirable that the air
be delivered to the balance room via a perforated false ceiling or similar
widely dispersed ducting ports in order to attenuate air currents as much as
possible. A procedure sometimes adopted is to switch off the air conditioning
plant when actually carrying out weighing. Provided the balance room is
well insulated, as it should be, the temperature change over the period
required for diluting and dispensing, say one hour, will be negligible and
the desirable conditions of a positive thermal gradient and minimal vibration
will be realized. Accurate weighings can only be started if thermal equilibrium
has been reached by the balance and its environment; some experts recommend
that the operator should sit in front of the balance for at least 15 minutes
before weighing commences in order to attain a sufficient degree of thermal
equilibrium. Smoking should be prohibited in the balance room to reduce
the possibility of tar and other products condensing on the balance mechanism.
The temperature and humidity fluctuations for adjacent preparatory rooms
may be somewhat greater but the mean values should be the same as those
of the balance room in order to avoid long delays in vessels and solutions
reaching equilibrium with the balance environment.

While the stability of commercially available balance weights is normally
adequate, very small amounts of dirt will introduce errors and regular
cleaning and recalibration of the weights is recommended. Even when
regularly cleaned, occasionally a weight has been observed to change
its actual mass over a period of years due, presumably, to a surface chemical
effect and small but nevertheless significant changes can take place over
short periods for no obvious reason <<eijk1972>>, <<moret>>. It is therefore recommended that
the balance weights be calibrated, independently of the manufacturer,
before being put into service and annually thereafter; this requires an
access to professional mass metrology services. In principle this calibration
can be achieved by a single reference weight, the fractional uncertainty
being the same for all the (smaller) weights calibrated using the reference
weight <<merritt1973>> but in view of the possible mass changes mentioned above it is
advisable to have several calibrated reference weights available. It should
be noted that the response of a balance on its optical scale is not necessarily
linear and thus the scale should also be calibrated <<moret>>, <<merritt1973>>, <<brulmans>>, <<gallic1973>>.

Apart from the calibration of the balance weights and optical scale the
following tests should be carried out by the balance user when the balance
is first installed and from time to time thereafter in order to assure himself
that its performance has not deteriorated :

. the variation of sensitivity over the optical scale
. the variation of sensitivity with time, and eventually
. test of randomness.

These and more extensive performance tests may be found in the literature
<<lashof>>, <<bell>>, <<humphries>>, <<norman>>, <<astm>>, <<gallic1971>>.

Static charge may build up on glassware and plastic materials and can cause
serious errors in weighing particularly when using small balance enclosures
<<colas1973>>. These difficulties may be avoided by means of a radioactive static
charge eliminator situated within the enclosure. The source may be a
stem:[beta]-emitter such as ^204^Tl or ^90^Sr-^90^Y and in such cases, for safety reasons,
a mechanical shutter is often arranged to close over the source when the
balance enclosure is opened. On the other hand stem:[alpha]-emitters are much more
efficient eliminators of static charge and considerably weaker sources may
be used without the necessity of a shutter <<colas1973>>, although with such emitters
the experimenter should be aware of the possibility of recoil contamination.
In this respect the use of ^210^Po should be avoided.

A most important requirement in the manipulation of both active and inactive
solutions is that all vessels used shall be scrupulously clean, and this also
applies to the ampoules into which the active solutions are finally dispensed
for distribution. Some typical methods for cleaning such vessels are
described in <<appendix1>>. If required, clean glassware may be given
a water-repellent silicone coating. This treatment is necessary for glass
pycnometers, but is not recommended for ampoules since the coating is
destroyed by flame sealing. Some laboratories coat other glassware such as
dilution flasks, scintillation vials, etc., whereas others recommend against
this. Procedures for silicone-coating glass together with some advantages and
disadvantages of doing so are given in <<appendix2>>. Polyethylene is naturally
hydrophobic, but adsorption or absorption has been observed to occur with
polyethylene surfaces. Polyethylene is also porous to some solvents <<hamilton>>, <<keith>>, <<merritt1967>>, <<rytz>>, <<bowes>>.

== Outline of Procedures

The procedures normally involved in distributing a standard of radioactivity
and in making an accurate activity measurement are schematically
illustrated in the chart of <<fig1>>. Naturally the details may vary in an
individual laboratory or for particular radionuclides but in general
<<fig1>> represents the brood outline of the manipulations required.

In brief, the master solution is dispensed into as many ampoules as may be
necessary for the intercomparison or distribution. A few of these ampoules
are retained for the measurement of the activity per unit moss of solution
and the remaining ampoules are distributed to laboratories participating in
the intercomparison. Because the radioactive concentration of the master
solution and the aliquot size are selected so that the filled ampoules
provide a suitable ionization chamber response to give a convenient
measuring time (or contain sufficient radioactivity for a particular purpose)
it is usually necessary to dilute the distributed solution to a level which is
suitable for making sources for counting. As will be seen below, the dilution
stage should not introduce a significant error into the measurement of the
radioactive concentration.

Having diluted the solution to a suitable level the next step is to prepare
the counting sources. These will usually be dispensed either on to thin
metal-coated VYNS footnote:[VYNS is a copolymer of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate. Details af the production and metallising af such films may be found in the literature <<pate>>, <<lowenthal1964>>, <<colas1971>>.] or other films for gas proportional counting or into
suitable vials for liquid scintillation counting. The solution is dispensed
from a vessel (a pycnometer) and the mass deposited may be determined in
two ways. In the first method the mass of the solution deposited is obtained
by weighing the pycnometer before and after dispensing the drop of solution
and this is usually referred to as the pycnometer method. The second method
involves the weighing of the source mount (or scintillation vial) before and
after dispensing the drop of solution. To correct for the evaporation of the
solution from an open source mount the mass of source mount plus solution is
observed as a function of time and an extrapolation made to obtain the
combined mass at the instant the drop was dispensed. This is called the
extrapolation method. Only by careful attention to detail can these two
methods be made to agree; in general the pycnometer method is to be
preferred and is recommended in this monograph. This is not to say that
the extrapolation method cannot be used successfully but only that there is
an inherent systematic error in the technique due to a non constant rate of
evaporation near time zero <<colas1973>>, <<campion1964>>, <<eijk1967>>. In order to minimise the
uncertainty due to this effect the use of on electrobalance is essential.

*The master solution*

While a detailed discussion of the physical and chemical composition of
master solutions is beyond the scope of this monograph it is relevant
to mention some of the more important factors which should be considered
when specifying such solutions. The purpose for which a standard of
radioactivity is required is one such factor which may influence the choice
of chemical composition, approximate radioactive concentration, and
perhaps, container. This monograph is mainly concerned with the use of
solutions in international comparisons where considerations of accuracy are
paramount, but for distributions from standardizing laboratories other factors
such as the specific application of the standard and even the cost may,
in part, determine the choice of characteristics.

In general, the objective is to achieve a stable solution having negligible
adsorption on container walls but at the same time having a low dissolved
solids content in order that thin sources with as small a self-absorption as
practicable may be prepared for stem:[4pi] counting. A related consideration is
that both acid and alkaline solutions tend to leach out glass so increasing
the concentration of dissolved solids <<preiss>>, <<gallic1967>>, <<korenman>>. This increase depends on the
strength of acid or base in the solution, the type of glass forming the container
and the length of time of contact; values of the order· of stem:[100" "mu"g/g"] of solids
have been reported after several months of storage in Pyrex glass <<lowenthal1973>>.
Quartz is relatively insoluble and has been used far the storage of standard
solutions <<hamilton>>, <<gallic1967>> and although polyethylene vessels are also good in this
respect <<korenman>> they are slightly porous. Thus, if it is necessary to achieve
the absolute minimum of dissolved solids, both reagents and water should
be freshly distilled using quartz utensils footnote:[Typically, once-distilled water contains solids to the extent of about stem:[1" "mu"g/g"] while triple distillation in quartz stills will reduce this by about an order of magnitude. Triply-distilled and deionized water contains solids to the extent of about stem:[0.01" "mu"g/g"] <<korenman>>; however deionized water is rarely free from organic matter. A recent review of the production of ultrapure water has been given in reference <<smith>>.]. However, the widespread use of
the coincidence technique and its extension to the tracer method for pure
stem:[beta]-emitters reduce the need for such extreme measures and analytical grade
reagents and water distilled in borosilicate stills are usually adequate.

Adsorption is another phenomenon that must be considered and the carrier
concentration and the pH of the master solution should be chosen to minimise
this; as a general guide a concentration of about stem:[100" "mu"g"] of carrier per
gram of on acid (usually HCl or HN0~3~) solution of 0.1 mol in stem:[1" dm"^3] of
water is acceptable but concentrations both above and below these guide
line values may be required for particular radionuclides. Some radionuclide
solutions are particularly susceptible to bacterial growth which can absorb
activity from the solution. In such cases the solutions should contain
a bacteriostat such as 0.1% formalin or be heat sterilized after having been
sealed in the ampoules. The latter is in any case considered to be a desirable
practice if the ampoules are to be stored for a considerable length of time.
A useful guide to the chemistry of various radionuclides in dilute solutions
has been published <<usaec>>.

It should be noted that radiolysis can produce an increase in pressure in
closed vessels containing radioactive solutions. For radioactive concentrations
of the order of stem:[100" "mu"Ci"] per gram of solution the effect is usually negligible
and sealed glass ampoules can be safely used for the long term storage of
solutions. For large radioactive concentrations there is the danger of mechanical
rupture (for example, a gram of solution containing an activity of 10 mCi
of an stem:[alpha]-emitting nuclide will produce in six weeks about stem:[1" cm"^3] of gas at NTP
due to radiolytic decomposition but even more important from the point of
view of radionuclide metrology is the question of the chemical stability of
such solutions.

The remarks made in the Introduction with regard to acceptable uncertainty
limits apply with equal emphasis to the radionuclide purity of the activity;
this should be checked using a method whose sensitivity is compatible with
the overall uncertainty limits and, if necessary, chemical separations
performed before preparing the master solution.

*Dispensing the master solution*

A number of glass or, if necessary, quartz ampoules which can subsequently
be flame sealed must be selected and prepared. Although the quantity of
master solution dispensed into each ampoule is determined gravimetrically
it is usually checked by means of measurements in a re-entrant , or well-type,
ionization chamber; in some metrological laboratories use is made of Nal(Tl)
or Ge(Li) detectors for the comparison of activities. In order that the stem:[gamma]-ray
absorption properties of ampoules should be the same, the dimensional
tolerances of the ampoules should be such that any differences in absorption
are negligible. A convenient method for ascertaining this is described in
<<appendix5>>. After selection, the ampoules should be cleaned (see <<appendix1>>)
and left in the balance room for several hours in order to attain thermal and
hydrometric equilibrium. It is convenient to identify each ampoule at
this stage; this may be done by a temporary wax pencil marking, labelling,
engraving the glass, or by labelling clean containers each holding an ampoule.
In order to fill the ampoules a large capacity dispensing vessel having
a long bent spout suitable for entering the necks of the ampoules or
a pipette with a long tip can be used. Alternatively, an automatic burette
can provide a convenient method for filling ampoules. The pipette or
burette should be carefully cleaned as described in <<appendix1>>. Both the
master solution, in a stoppered bottle, and the dispensing vessel should be
in thermal equilibrium with the balance room environment.

One particular design of pipette and associated equipment suitable for
dispensing solutions is shown in <<fig2>>; it has a capacity of some stem:[35" cm"^3].
The whole instrument consists of a reservoir tank connected to a manifold
which, by means of stopcocks, con be connected to (a) the atmosphere
(b) a vacuum pump or (&#x200c;c) a constant pressure supply of filtered nitrogen gas.
The stopcocks can be operated manually or electro-mechanically. In the
latter case it is a simple matter to arrange for stopcock (&#x200c;c) to be opened
for a fixed time thus delivering a predetermined volume of solution ; The
pipette stem is immersed in the master solution and the manifold connected
to the vacuum pump; the stopcock is closed when the pipette is about two
thirds full and a little solution expelled to waste by momentarily opening
the stopcock (&#x200c;c). The stem is wiped dry with a tissue and the first ampoule
is brought up to the stem and filled by opening the stopcock (&#x200c;c) for the
appropriate time. An automatic burette, of which there are several models
available commercially, may also be used provided that the tip is suitable
for insertion into an ampoule. In order to keep the liquid surface well away
from the hot flame when sealing,the ampoules should not be filled to capacity.
For example stem:[1" cm"^3] of solution in stem:[2" cm"^3] ampoule, 3 to stem:[4" cm"^3] solution in
stem:[5" cm"^3] ampoule and corresponding volumes in ampoules of other capacities
are considered appropriate quantities.

The ampoules are first weighed empty, reweighed after filling and then
immediately flame sealed (see <<fig3>>). It is a useful precaution to test
for pinhole leaks at this stage by immersing in hot water (at about 60 °C)
for 30 seconds; small bubbles of air will appear if there is a leak.

As a uniformity check on the weighing procedure the sealed ampoules should
be measured in a re-entrant ionization chamber. The quotient (ionization
chamber current)/ (mass of solution) should be the same for all ampoules
to within the precision of the measurement. Any ampoule which shows a
significant difference from the mean of this quotient should be rejected.
However for those radionuclides which are not amenable to such an
ionization chamber check it is advisable to duplicate all weighings on
a second balance; this may be done before sealing the ampoules and preferably
by a second operator in which case the second weighing can be completed
within a few minutes of the first. If however there is an appreciable time
interval the ampoules may be temporarily sea led with a suitable plastic film
or rubber cap. Alternatively, a second weighing is possible *after* the ampoule
has been sealed; in this case the remainder of the glass stem must be
included in the weighing. Tests of this method have shown that, when
borosilicate glass ampoules of stem:[2" cm"^3] nominal capacity and containing 1 g
of woter are sealed with the equipment shown in <<fig3>>, there is an
apparent average mass loss of about 0.25 mg but that, when the ampoules
are reopened, the average mass loss is reduced to less than 0.05 mg.
Subsidiary experiments have shown that this phenomenon is mainly due to
the expansion and partial loss of air within the ampoule on heating, most
of this loss being made good on reopening. Thus, it is evident that the
change in radioactive concentration due to the ampoule sealing process is
negligible for all practical purposes.

As indicated above, the comparison of activities within the ampoules may
also be carried out by means of Nal(Tl) or Ge(Li} detectors. Having sealed
and checked the ampoules they should then be labelled. The information on
the label should include at least the rodionuclide, the opproxi mote activity
(with date) and a reference number. More details can be given if space permits,
but in any case a separate statement (which should not be confused with the
statement of the final result) should accompany each ampoule dispatched
and give not only the above information but also the mass and chemical
composition of the solution.

The evaporation rate from an unsealed glass ampoule has been quoted as
about 0.5 mg/h <<eijk1972>> to 2 mg/h <<bowes>> but, even allowing 12 minutes for
weighing, these rates represent possible fractional losses of only 0.01 to
0.04% for 1 g aliquots and correspondingly smaller fractional losses for larger
aliquots. Hence the change in radioactive concentration due both to evaporation
from unsealed ampoules whilst weighing and to the sealing process itself,
should be negligible.

Two or three ampoules for measurement should be selected at random from the
batch, the remainder being available for distribution.

== Details of Procedures: Receiving Laboratory

On receipt by a laboratory the outside of the ampoules should be checked
for activity by means of a wipe test. The contents should then be thoroughly
shaken to overcome any distillation phenomena that may have occurred in
transit and the solution induced to drain completely from the ampoule tip.
Simple tapping of the ampoule is usually sufficient to obtain this provided
a rounded flame-sealed end, rather than a pointed tip has been achieved;
centrifuging would certainly ensure proper drainage. The ampoules should
then be left in the balance room in order to achieve thermal equilibrium
with their environment.

In order to provide an independent check on tile dilution factor as obtained
by the gravimetric procedure described below, it is recommended that
ionization chamber measurements be made on aliquots of both the undiluted
and diluted solutions of those radionuclides which emit suitable photon
radiation. If the dynamic range of the ionization chamber is adequate and
the ampoules in which the solution is received are the same as those
customarily used by the laboratory for ionization chamber work, then it is
possible to make measurements on the ampoules before opening them.
However, the second condition is rather unlikely to be fulfilled, in which
case it is necessary to transfer some of the solution to "standard" ampoules.
These standard ampoules should, if necessary, be topped up to a constant
height in the normal way by the addition of inactive solution (see <<appendix5>>).
However, if the quantity of active solution is limited, no additional solution
should be added so that the ampoules may be reopened after the ionization
chamber measurements and the contents used in the preparation of the diluted
solutions.

*Dilution*

The dilution procedure requires a stoppered glass dilution flask, a transfer
pycnometer which may be glass or polyethylene, a suitable glass funnel and
a further vessel containing the diluent. The dilution flask may be any suitable
vessel and a variety of shapes have been used, but an Erlenmeyer or
volumetric flask of about 10 to stem:[20" cm"^3] capacity can be recommended;
volumetric flasks are available with plastic screw caps and teflon gaskets
and provide a useful alternative to glass stoppers which may be lightly
greased or used "dry". The advantage of lightly greasing is, of course, that
the solution may be stored for a long period of time with the assurance that
no loss due to evaporation can take place and that it allows the flask to be
repeatedly inverted for mixing purposes; plastic screw caps are also advantageous
in this respect. On the other hand the evaporation rate from a dry stoppered
flask is sufficiently small that it may be used for the dilution process when
sources are to be dispensed immediately. The necessity for inverting the
flask to achieve complete mixing has been questioned <<rytz>>, <<bowes>>. The arguments
for not inverting the flask are, firstly, to avoid liquid, which is not yet
mixed, being trapped in the stopper or cap crevices and, secondly, where
the solution is to be assayed by liquid scintillation counting, to avoid any
possible contamination of the scintillator by grease which, according to
some authorities <<grinberg>>, may cause quenching. However, the proponents for
inverting suggest it as a safeguard for complete mixing <<merritt1973>>. The important
point is to be aware of the possible pitfalls in whichever technique is
adopted. Further it is equally important that all the glassware should be
clean (see <<appendix1>>) and in thermal equilibrium with the balance room
environment. The pycnometer may readily be made from commercially
available virgin polyethylene bottles footnote:[Supplied by Canus Equipment Ltd., 340 Gladstone Avenue, Ottawa, Canada]. A technique for making such
pycnometers is described in <<appendix3>>. Glass pycnometers may also be
used <<campion1964>>; however, it is necessary to grind and flame the pycnometer
tips in order to produce a smooth rounded surface and then add a water-repellent
coating (<<appendix2>>); they also require a detachable (via a dry
cone and joint) rubber bulb or syringe to expel the solution. The polyethylene
pycnometer is possibly to be preferred for diluting and dispensing sources.
In general the diluent should be mode up to maintain the same inactive
chemical composition and concentration as the master solution; however,
if the experimenter has evidence that a lower carrier concentration is
acceptable from the point of view of adsorption then the chemical composition
of the diluent may be chosen so that this lower concentration is achieved
in the diluted solution. The diluent can be conveniently stored in a graduated
flask with a dry stopper and subsequently transferred to the dilution flask
by means of the glass funnel. Both vessels and diluent should be in thermal
equilibrium with their environment.

The dilution flask is first weighed. If a dry stopper is to be used then the
stopper may, if desired, be weighed with the flask (but note that, when
making two or more dilutions, a flask and its stopper should be clearly
identified) although if a greased stopper is to be used the flask only should
be weighed <<merritt1973>>. Opening of the ampoule containing the solution to be
diluted can be accomplished by drawing a file mark near the top of the neck.
The tip is then cracked by momentarily contacting the file mark with either
a small bead of molten glass or a red hot wire. Immediately after the glass tip
has been removed, the liquid should be withdrawn into the pycnometer. There
is usually no need to withdraw all of the solution and it is much more
important to remove an adequate sample (a gram or more) quickly in one
operation without expelling air into the solution from the pycnometer.
Because the operator's hand may disturb the thermal equilibrium of the
pycnometer and contents it is essential to handle pycnometers only with long
tweezers or other remote handling equipment (<<fig4>>). The time required
for transfer should not toke more than a few minutes at the most. After
withdrawing the solution the outside of the pycnometer stem is wiped with
a tissue and, if small droplets are found to adhere to the interior, a few
drops are expelled to waste. The pressure on the ampoule (in the case of
a polyethylene pycnometer) or on the detachable syringe (in the case of
a glass pycnometer) is then released slowly so as to leave the stem free of
liquid droplets. The pycnometer should then be weighed, care being taken
to ensure that the pycnometer and contents are still in thermal equilibrium
with the balance enclosure.

The pycnometer is then removed from the balance and preferably not less
than several hundred milligrams of the solution are dispensed into the dilution
flask in such a way that droplets are not allowed to adhere to the glass
walls near the neck of the flask. The pycnometer is then reweighed. Some
laboratories also reweigh the (stoppered) flask ot this point. The difference
in weight will be slightly less than that indicated by the pycnometer
weighings {which should be used in calculating the dilution factor} owing to
evaporation losses but it serves as a check on gross weighing mistakes.
Next, the diluent should be added to the dilution flask via the funnel or
other suitable means of transfer such as a pipette, care being again taken
to prevent splashing. The dilution flask is then reweighed together with,
if appropriate, its stopper footnote:[At the expense of making the check on the pycnometer weighings rather less sensitive, the order in which the components are added to the dilution flask may be reversed but opinion is divided on this. Adding the diluent first is done in order to occupy any adsorption sites with inactive rather than active material, while adding the active solution to the diluent is felt by some to cause more splashing. In one procedure part of the diluent is put into the flask first and the remainder after delivery of the active solution.]. Immediately after weighing, the contents of
the dilution flask should be mixed. Care should be taken to ensure that
any drops which may have adhered to the walls of the flask should not
escape being mixed with the main volume. As indicated above, opinion
is divided on whether or not the dilution flask should be inverted in order
to mix the master solution and the diluent. The evidence to date suggests
that complete mixing can be achieved by gently swirling the solution in
the dilution flask <<rytz>> and in order to carry out this swirling effectively
the flask should not be filled to more than half its nominal capacity.

If A is the mass of the dilution flask empty, D the mass of flask plus total
solution, and B and C the pycnometer plus solution masses before and after
expelling the master solution into the flask, then the dilution factor is
(D-A)/(B-C). At least one further dilution should be made from the same
ampoule and the dilution factor varied by an appreciable amount, say a
factor of two. In general, dilution factors should not exceed 50 in any one
dilution and preferably should not be more than 30. If a larger factor is
necessary it may be achieved in two or more stages. Larger factors may also
be achieved provided that a balance of suitable capacity is available to
accommodate a larger dilution flask; however, it should be remembered that
the greater the dilution the more difficult it becomes to achieve complete
mixing.

The dilution procedure itself is now complete. The remainder of the solution
in the pycnometer can be stored either by delivering it to a glass ampoule
which is then flame sealed or, if contained in a polyethylene pycnometer,
by simply sealing the capillary in a microflame. It should be realized,
however, that there is an evaporation loss through the polyethylene walls
which may be of the order of 0.1 mg per day. Although this can be reduced
by storing the ampoule in a closed container in which there is an open vessel
containing an inactive solution of the same chemical composition as that
within the ampoule <<bowes>>,it is recommended that, for storage over an
appreciable period of time, a flame-sealed glass ampoule or greased stoppered
flask be used.

*Source preparation*

The next stage is the preparation of sources suitable for counting and,
if a sensitive ionization chamber is available, also of sealed ampoules in order
to check the dilution factor by ionization current ratios. A series of suitable
source mounts is required for stem:[4pi] proportional counting or vials for liquid
scintillation counting, together with a few ampoules. It is, of course,
imperative that a different pycnometer be used for the transfer of the diluted
solution from that used for the strong solution, and indeed pycnometers
should be discarded after use. Again all glassware should be clean and in
thermal equilibrium with the balance room environment.

Some solution is carefully drawn into the pycnometer without bubbling and
the outside of the pycnometer stem wiped with a tissue. In one weighing
technique the pycnometer is weighed using the set of balance weights and
then a drop or two of the solution is dispensed on to the source mount,
the pycnometer being immediately weighed again: this weighing is also the
initial weighing for the second source. Thus a series of some 7 to 10 sources
can be prepared and, after counting, the mean value for the activity per
unit mass of the solution is calculated. In this way the uncertainties associated
with the individual weights used for all but the first and lost weighings of the
series are cancelled, i.e. they do not contribute any uncertainty to the mean
value for the radioactive concentration. An alternative technique is
substitution weighing and involves the use of the optical scale and a reference
weight approximately equal to the mass of the liquid drop dispensed. The
pycnometer is first counterpoised on the balance and the reading of the
optical scale noted, the internal balance weigh ts being used as tares only.
A drop is then expelled on to a source mount and the pycnometer together
with the reference weight are placed on the balance pan. The new optical
scale reading which, with care, will be close to the first, is recorded.
The mass of the expelled drop is thus the algebraic difference between these
two readings plus the mass of the reference weight <<gallic1973>>. The heavy reliance
that this method puts on a single calibrated reference weight can be avoided
by using a series of such weights <<williams>>. With care both techniques can give
adequate precision and accuracy; however it is not the intention of this
monograph to discuss the relative merits of these two methods at this point
in time particularly since the recent commercial development of electrobalances
will to some extent influence such an evaluation.

In using polyethylene pycnometers particularly, it sometimes happens that,
due to capillary forces, some of the solution remains in the stem after dispensing
a source. Thus the air inside the pycnometer cannot come into contact
with the ambient air and is at a slightly lower pressure. Hence, on reweighing
the pycnometer, the volume of the dispensed drop is not replaced by ambient
air as is required for the normal buoyancy correction (see <<appendix4>>).
This effect can be avoided by first holding the pycnometer with the stem
in an upwards direction and gently squeezing. With the pressure still applied
the pycnometer is turned downwards and a drop dispensed on to the mount
by additional squeezing. After releasing, the pressure inside the pycnometer
will reduce and allow the withdrawal of all the solution from the capillary.
For solid sources prepared for stem:[4pi] proportional counting, source masses in
the range 20 to 50 mg have been found to be acceptable and the dilution
fac tor should be so arranged that sources in this mass range give a suitable
counting rate. If seeding or spreading agents are to be used to improve the
uniformity of sources for stem:[4pi] proportional counting these may be dispensed
on to the source mount before the deposition of the active solution since
any splashing resulting from the first operation is then immaterial. Different
radionuclides may, of course, require different source preparation techniques:
a survey of source preparation procedures, which includes on extensive list
of references to recent work in this area, may be found in reference <<eijk1973>>.

For liquid scintillation counting the scintillator and radioactive solutions
may be dispensed into the counting vials separately. In many cases this is
the preferred method since the alternative, that of pre-mixing the
sinctillator and radioactive solutions, involves weighing solutions having
high vapour pressures, although an elegant method to overcome the problem
of rapid evaporation has been described <<garfinkel>>. The pre-mixing method does
however have the advantage of weighing a considerably larger mass of
radioactive solution with the consequent reduction in the fractional
uncertainty associated with this step but, because a known aliquot must
be extracted from the bulk solution for each counting vial, it is essential
that the components be thoroughly mixed by, for example, mechanical
shaking <<vaninbroukx>>. While mixing is also desirable in the first method it is
equally important that drops of the solution do not become lodged in the
crevices of the vial cap or stopper and hence for this method gentle swirling
is recommended; alternatively, the contents may be mixed by means of
a (clean) glass stirring rod. Most laboratories which use liquid scintillation
counting for the establishment of radioactivity standards use to luene
(or xylene) for the main solvent with about 10 to 20% ethanol as an intermediate
solvent together with PPO and POPOP as primary and secondary solutes
respectively. In preparing and mixing these solutions with the radioactive
solution it is convenient to add the ethanol to the mixing flask or counting
vial first, then add a known quantity of the radioactive solution from a
pycnometer and then, finally, add the scintillator solution itself. It is
necessary to establish the maximum quantity of aqueous solution that can
be incorporated into the scintillator solution and yet still maintain complete
miscibility. Further, the conditions required to prevent adsorption from
the final mixture on to the vial walls should also be established. For toluene
based scintillators it is found that a relatively high acid concentration is
required and some workers add a drop of concentrated acid to the ethanol
before the addition of the radioactive aliquot and the scintillator solution.
Dioxane based scintillators can accommodate considerably weaker solutions
without adsorption but suffer from the fact that dioxane exhibits chemi-luminescence on contact with water. Because of the possible sensitivity
of both vials and solutions to phosphore scence induced by light <<vaninbroukx>>, <<scales>>
the entire source preparation should be carried out in subdued red light or,
alternatively, the filled vials should be stored for several days in the dark
prior to counting.

For radionuclides emitting suitable photon radiation, some ampoules should
be filled with the diluted solution, sealed and measured in an ionization
chamber. Two or three such ampoules can be prepared either immediately
before or immediately after (or preferably both) the preparation of the
counting sources. These measurements together with similar measurements on
ampoules prepared from the undiluted master solution enable an independent
check on the dilution factor to be obtained. Subsequently, these ampoules
can be used, if necessary, for impurity checks by, for example, half life
measurements and stem:[gamma]-ray spectroscopy. It is recommended that at least two
ampoules of the master solution should be opened and at least two dilutions
made from each, with the dilution factors differing by on appreciable amount.

*Efficiency tracer measurements*

The efficiency tracer technique for the measurement of pure stem:[beta]-emitters
requires a known amount of tracer activity to be added to the unknown
pure stem:[beta]-activity. It is a simple matter to prepare and calibrate a solution
of the stem:[beta-gamma] tracer activity using the diluting and dispensing procedures
described above. The mixing of the two solutions is best carried out ot
the diluted level (i.e. at about a concentration level of stem:[10" "mu"Ci/g"]). That
is to say, both unknown and tracer activities are separately diluted and
then combined together by dispensing quantities of the order of 1 gram
of each into a suitable flask and mixing. Counting sources may then be
prepared; if, in stem:[4pi] proportional counting, seeding or spreading agents are
to be used there may be, as mentioned above, some advantage in depositing
these and any inactive carrier before dispensing the active solution.

== Uncertainties

The random and systematic errors associated with the manipulations described
above have been discussed by several authors. It has been reported <<merritt1967>>, <<bowes>>
that the random uncertainties for repeated measurements are of the order of
0.02% and that any systematic uncertainties should be considerably less than
this, provided that "good laboratory practice" is followed. An experimental
measurement of 233 sources prepared from 33 dilutions <<rytz>> gave standard
deviations ranging from 0.010 to 0.099%. Due to the widely differing
measurement conditions, the 33 values cannot be combined rigorously.
However, the arithmetic mean of 0.055% is perhaps representative of the
standard deviation to be expected. Of this value about 0.05% is accounted
for by counting statistics leaving about 0.02% due to the random uncertainty
associated with diluting and source preparation, - in rather good agreement
with the estimates found in references <<merritt1967>> and <<bowes>>. The former authors
derived by experiment the random uncertainty associated with the weighing
of a single drop, using their balance and dispensing technique, as about
stem:[12" "mu"g"] (standard deviation) which can be compared with an earlier estimate
of stem:[10" "mu"g"] for a different type of balance <<campion1964>>. Another report <<gallic1973>> estimates
an uncertainty of stem:[12" "mu"g"] for a single drop measurement; however this value
includes some systematic as well as random components. In this analysis of
the problem, the author emphasizes the need for careful calibration of the
balance weights and optical scale by means of reference weights calibrated
by a mass metrology laboratory.

A recent comparison of metal masses in the range 20 to 100 mg has suggested
that professional mass metrology laboratories agree to about stem:[\+- 1" "mu"g"], while
the agreement obtained in a number 0.( radionuclide laboratories using
Mettler M5 balances was about stem:[+-6" "mu"g"] when using either calibrated dial
weights and optical scales or calibrated reference weights <<moret>>. However
deviations of stem:[+- 10" "mu"g"] or more were observed using uncalibrated balances,
that is to say, balances which had no calibration other than the
manufacturer's specification. Since these uncertainties refer to the mass
determination of solid samples, as opposed to liquid samples, and were
obtained under ideal conditions they must be regarded as the ultimate
limit that may be achieved by current technique. In any practical situation
in radionuclide metrology the uncertainties may be considerably greater.
Effects which may contribute to the systematic uncertainty include the
following:

. Evaporation from open ampoules, pycnometers and dilution flasks.
In a typical situation in which the manipulative procedures were
assumed to take about four hours, this effect has been assessed to be
about 0.004% <<bowes>> and shown experimentally to be less than 0.03% <<goodier>>.
. Adherence of droplets on the tip of pycnometers. For carefully
prepared glass pycnometers this has been shown to be less than
stem:[1" "mu"g"], i.e. 0.005% on a 20 mg drop <<campion1964>>. Since polyethylene
is a hydrophobic material the adherence of droplets on pycnometers
made of this material is likely to be small although no experiments
establishing limits have been published.
. Buoyancy correction (see <<appendix4>>). The correction for commonly
used solutions and balance weights is about 0.1% and this value
would seldom vary by more than a few per cent.
. Uncertainties in the balance weights and, if fitted, the optical
scale of the balance. Typically, individual weights are quoted
by commercial suppliers as better than stem:[\+- 10" "mu"g"], or when taken
in groups, better than stem:[+- 20" "mu"g"] of their nominal value. However,
weights may be individually calibrated to higher accuracies and
in any case it is essential to check the manufacturer's specification.
There may also be some non linearity in the response of the optical
scale. A useful discussion of these points is given in the recent
report on mass comparisons mentioned above <<moret>> and also in a report
on the performance of various microbalances <<brulmans>>.
. Uniformity of mixing. Any error due to this has been shown to be
very small <<rytz>>.

Systematic uncertainties are thus seen to be small but it must be emphasized
that much larger uncertainties may occur if the relatively simple
precautions described in this monograph are not taken.

== Conclusion

The extensive experimental work aimed at quantifying the possible
uncertainty estimates described above has shown that, with reasonable
precautions, the diluting and dispensing procedures should not introduce
total systematic and random uncertainties of more than 0.1% in the final
result of a radioactive concentration measurement and with care accuracies
better than this may be achieved. It is possible, and indeed almost
mandatory, to check the efficacy of the procedures at any laboratory
by carrying out the following internal check. A solution of, for example,
^60^Co is prepared and the manipulations described in this monograph
carried out. In this case several ampoules (> 5) of the master solution
should be prepared, opened, diluted and sources dispensed, making two
dilutions from each ampoule. The sources should be counted with sufficient
statistical precision in a stem:[4pi beta-gamma] coincidence system. If the total spread
of the results from these ten or more dilutions is less than 0.2% the procedures
are of sufficient precision to be acceptable. Such an internal check should
be carried out by every laboratory before participating in an international
comparison.

== Cleaning Treatment for Glass and Polyethylene Vessels

While glass of one type or another is the most frequently used material for
vessels and containers in chemical work, it is not possible to obtain
a universally clean glass surface. What may be acceptable for one purpose
may not be for another. A discussion of this together with a description of
the various types of glasses, their surface properties under different conditions
and detailed cleaning treatments may be found in the literature <<adams>>.
However, the following three methods for cleaning new glass or polyethylene
vessels have been found satisfactory for most work in radioactivity metrology.

*Method I*:: The vessels are soaked for 24 hours in Q solution of sodium
dichromate in concentrated sulphuric acid ("chromic acid"). They are then
rinsed three times in distilled water and once in ethanol and finally dried
in an oven at 35 °C. Rinsing should be thorough since the presence of
sulphate ions can cause precipitation or colloidal effects in solutions
containing cations which form insoluble sulphates. Chromate ion is also
strongly sorbed on glass <<korenman>>. It may be removed with a complexing agent,
e.g. by rinsing with dilute oxalic acid followed by a distilled water rinse.

*Method II* (for glassware only):: The vessels or ampoules are filled with hot
carrier solution of the same concentration as used later for the radioactive
solution. They are then dipped for two to three hours in a boiling water-bath.
Thereafter they are emptied, rinsed with deionized water and dried in an
oven at about 50 °C.

*Method III*:: The vessels are immersed in a solution comprising approximately
60% (by volume) deionized water, 35% concentrated nitric acid, 3% concentrated
hydrofluoric acid and 2% liquid detergent (e.g. Teepol), for 5 to
10 minutes depending on the age of the solution footnote:[The solution should be stored in a polyethylene container.]. The vessels are then rinsed
with deionized water three times. In the case of narrow necked ampoules
it may be necessary to expel the water by blowing filtered nitrogen gas into
the ampoule through a thin tube inserted down the neck. The glassware is
then dried in an oven at about 100 °C for a time depending on the size and
shape of the article. For a glass pycnometer, for example, with a narrow
orifice the time required is about three hours but is considerably less for
dilution flasks. In the case of polyethylene pycnometers a lower oven
temperature for a somewhat longer time is required since polyethylene becomes
soft at 100 °C.

[[appendix2]]
[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Water-repellent Silicone Coatings

If it is considered necessary glassware con be made extremely water repellent
by the following techniques. Glassware must first be cleaned and dried
(at < 200 °C to avoid irreversible dehydroxylation of the surface). A number
of commercial preparations are available <<smith>>, <<adams>>, usually as solutions
of mixed chlorosilanes (chiefly dimethyldichlorosilane) in a suitable solvent
such as benzene or carbon tetrachloride. On contacting the glass surface
the chlorosilanes are hydrolysed by the reactive hydroxy groups and any
absorbed atmospheric water on the glass surface to form a water-repellent
polysiloxane film. The coating is applied by momentarily immersing the
glassware in the silicone solution and rinsing with benzene or carbon
tetrachloride to remove the HCl formed. The vessels are then left to drain.
It should be noted that same silicone fluids (e.g. methylhydrogensiloxane,
which forms 0 very durable surface, but, unlike dimethyldichlorosilone,
requires baking for 2 to 3 hours at 140 °C) contain Si-H bonds which can
act as a reducing agent.

Water-repellent silicone coatings are necessary for glass pycnometers for
which a hydrophobic surface is essential to prevent errors caused by the
adherence of small droplets to the pycnometer tip <<campion1964>>. In addition, silicone-treated
glassware readily retains its state of cleanliness because the adhesion
of many substances to glass is reduced. Further, solutions stored in silicone-treated
glass remain relatively uncontaminated as leaching from the glass
surface and dissolution of the glass it self are inhibited. However, the major
advantage of silanization is that it prevents loss of activity from the solution
to the vessel walls for most (but not all) radionuclides. Silicone coated
glassware may be useful if it is necessary to store high specific activity
(e.g. "carrier free") solutions, although many laboratories prefer polyethylene
containers for this application. For radioactivity solution standards, however,
the carrier concentration and chemical form of the solution are chosen
to ensure that activity losses to clean untreated glass surfaces are negligible.

Some disadvantages of silanization are that the film may be removed to some
extent by alkaline solutions and partially filled containers may suffer an
impairment of the film at the line of the air-liquid interface after standing
for some time. In addition, the procedure is time consuming and found to be
unnecessary by many laboratories.

Of the cleaning procedures described in <<appendix1>>, it should be noted
that only Method III employing hydrofluoric acid will remove silicone surface
films completely.

== Preparation of Polyethylene Pycnometers

*Equipment required*

. Small glass blowing torch or Bunsen burner - a hot flame is not
desirable as polyethylene is quite soft at 100 °C. Neither is
a wide flame desirable.
. Forceps or tweezers.

*Procedure*

The plastic ampoules as received from the manufacturer have a capacity
of stem:[5" cm"^3] and a wall thickness of about 0.75 mm. The neck of the ampoule
is drawn out in much the same way as glass tubing. The base of the
ampoule is held between the thumb and first two fingers and the opening
at the neck is supported with forceps. The ampoule is held approximately
horizontally over the flame and rotated slowly, heating the thick portion
of the neck. Gradually most of the top 2 cm of the ampoule becomes
transparent. Then the ampoule is removed from the flame and drawn out
slowly to the desired length. (If it is drawn out quickly it will be pulled
into two pieces). It is held taut until it regains its translucent appearance.

The capillary is allowed to harden and is then cut with the flame, sealing
the end at the same time. It is good practice to apply at this stage a simple
manual compression test for possible pinhole leaks. When required for use,
the capillary is cut to length with a sharp blade. Typically the capillary
dimensions might be 80 mm long, 0.5 mm internal diameter and 1.0 mm
external diameter.

== The Buoyancy Correction

It is well known that a correction for buoyancy is necessary whenever the
mass of an object whose density differs from that of the balance weights
is to be determined. The true mass, stem:["m"], is related to the apparent mass, stem:[mu],
by

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
"m" = mu [1 + rho_a (1/rho - 1/(rho_w)) ],
++++

where stem:[rho_a] is the air density, stem:[rho_w] is the density of the weights and stem:[rho] that
of the object weighed. In the case of the pycnometer technique the use of
this equation is well justified since the evaporation rate from a well
designed pycnometer is very small. Thus stem:[rho_a] is sensibly constant and equal
to the ambient air density. It follows that, although two apparent masses
of pycnometer plus solution are recorded ond the difference taken, the stem:[rho]
in the above equation refers only to the solution which for most purposes
can be assumed to be water. Thus the correction can be made with some
certainty. However this is not necessarily the case for the extrapolation
technique where the density of the air surrounding the source mount may
vary as the drop evaporates.

The calibration of a set of weights is often given in terms of mosses of
hypothetical weight pieces of density stem:[8.0" g/cm"^3] which would balance the
members of the set in air of density stem:[0.0012" g/cm"^3]. The calibrated set can
then be regarded as a set of masses each member of which has a density of
stem:[8.0" g/cm"^3]. An alternative convention, common in some countries, is the
stem:[8.4//0.0012] basis, i.e. masses of assumed density stem:[8.4" g/cm"^3] weighed
in air of density stem:[0.0012" g/cm"^3]. Since it is unlikely that the weights have
a density of exactly stem:[8.0" g/cm"^3] (or stem:[8.4" g/cm"^3] as the case may be) it follows
that a further correction is necessary when weighing in air of density other
than stem:[0.0012" g/cm"^3]. Thus the above equation becomes <<colas>>

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
"m" = mu [1 + rho_a (1/rho - 1/(rho_(w_t))) + (1/(rho_(w_t)) - 1/(rho_(w_a))) 0.0012" g/cm"^3],
++++

where stem:[rho_(w_a)] is the density of the weights assumed by the laboratory calibrating
the set of weights and stem:[rho_(w_t)] is the true density of the weights. The last term
in the square brackets is small, being about stem:[1.2 xx 10^(-5)]
for stem:[rho_(w_a) = 8.4" g/cm"^3] and stem:[rho_(w_t) = 7.76" g/cm"^3], as compared with the second term which is about
stem:[10^(-3)] for aqueous samples. For measurements in air of density stem:[rho_a = 0.0012" g/cm"^3] the equation becomes

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
"m" = mu [1 + (1/(rho_(w_t)) - 1/(rho_(w_a))) 0.0012" g/cm"^3].
++++

The density of air in stem:["mg/cm"^3] as a function of pressure, temperature and
humidity is given by

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
rho_a = (273.15" K")/"T" [(B - 0.3783" p")/(760" mm")] 1.2929" mg/cm"^3,
++++

where stem:[B] is the barometric pressure in mm Hg, stem:["T"] is the absolute temperature
in kelvin and stem:["p"] is the vapour pressure of water in air in mm Hg. A convenient
chart for the buoyancy correction as a function of air pressure and temperature
has been published; the authors point out that, for aqueous samples, the
error introduced by neglecting humidity is small <<faure>>. The chart is based
on an assumed density for the balance weights of stem:[8.4" g/cm"^3], but, as indicated
above, the error introduced by using the charts in conjunction with weights
of density stem:[8.0" g/cm"^3] is small and may be neglected for most purposes.

[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Ionization Chamber Measurements

A review of ionization chamber techniques is beyond the scope of this
monograph but because of the usefulness of ionization chamber measurements
in checking weighings it is worth recording a few salient points. A recent
survey of ionization chamber techniques ma y be found in reference <<weiss>>.

The most useful type of instrument for this purpose is a well-type chamber
often coiled a "stem:[4pi gamma]" ionization chamber and which is frequently operated
at several atmospheres pressure in order to increase the sensitivity. Typically
this sensitivity may be several picoamperes per microcurie of ^60^Co. Strictly,
for the present purpose the chamber need not be calibrated in terms of
ionization current per unit activity but such a calibration is a very desirable
feature in that a rapid assay of the activity of a sample of a given radionuclide
may be made. Further, the advantages of a calibrated ionization chamber
in maintain in standards of activity ha ve been stressed on many occasions
<<mann>>, <<campion1965>>. An ionization chamber can compare ratios of activity (for the same
stem:[gamma]-ray emitting nuclide) with a standard error of the mean of better than
stem:[\+- 0.1%]; with care a precision of stem:[+- 0.02%] can be achieved in favourable cases.

The ampoule wall thickness and glass composition must be sufficiently
reproducible from ampoule to ampoule so that any variation in stem:[gamma]-ray
attenuation does not add significantly to the variance of the measurements.
For the same reason the ampoules should be filled, if necessary, by the addition
of inactive solution to a constant height. Although the use of the so-called
stem:[4pi] geometry makes source positioning less critical it is nevertheless necessary
to examine the chamber for maximum response and to ensure that ampoules
are positioned at this optimum point in a reproducible way. Care must be
taken to ensure that the activity be kept below such levels that the response,
as a function of activity, does not depart significantly from linearity.

The constancy of the ampoule wall thickness and glass composition can be
tested by means of a point source of low energy stem:[gamma]-rays mounted on the end
of a thin dip stick. The latter should be mounted in such a way that the
source is at the centre of the ampoule to be tested; the ampoule is then
positioned in a re-entrant ionization chamber and the ionization current
noted. About 2 mCi of ^241^Am, encapsulated at the end of a thin nickel
tube, makes a convenient dip stick source. The principal electromagnetic
radiation is a stem:[gamma]-ray of 60 keV for which the attenuation of the glass wall
of the ampoule is appreciable and hence the method is rather sensitive.
For a series of ampoules whose wall thickness is specified as being within
stem:[\+- 0.1" mm"] such ionization current measurements should be constant to within
stem:[+- 0.12%] (standard deviation). This implies that, for ^60^C radiation, the
uncertainty due to wall attenuation is not greater than stem:[+- 0.03%]. However
for some radionuclides, for example ^125^I, it may be desirable to select
ampoules in order to obtain even better uniformity.
