.Preface

This monograph is one of several to be published by the Bureau International
des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) on behalf of the Comité Consultatif pour les
Etalons de Mesure des Rayonnements lonisants (CCEMRI). The aim of this
series of publications is to review various topics which are of importance
for the measurement of ionizing radiation and radioactivity, in particular
those techniques normally used by participants in international comparisons.
It is hoped that these publications will prove to be useful reference volumes
both for those who are already engaged in this field and for those who are
approaching such measurements for the first time.

This volume is concerned with the problem of establishing an acceptably
low upper limit to the presence of spurious pulses in radiation detectors
used for the metrology of radionuclides; it was prepared for publication
by P.J. Campion.

== Introduction

This monograph is concerned with the methods available for the detection
and quantitative estimation of spurious pulses, the relevance of which
to the metrology of radionuclides need hardly be stressed. Spurious pulses
are regarded in this context as those resulting from the operation of the
detector itself in the process of recording a genuine event, the latter
being defined as the passage of an ionizing particle through the sensitive
volume of the detector. Such an event may give rise to a genuine pulse
at the output of the amplifier. All pulses which are not genuine in this
sense are spurious, but in the present paper only those spurious pulses
which occur as a result of a genuine event are considered. Thus pulses
due to breakdown across insulators, malfunctioning of ancillary electronic
equipment or the pick-up of extraneous signals are not considered here;
they are also present if there are no ionizing particles and can usually be
avoided by proper arrangement of the electronic circuits or, if reproducible,
be subtracted as background.

In the metrology of radionuclides two closely related situations concerning
spurious pulses are often encountered. Thus an attempt is made in this
monograph to distinguish between, on the one hand, the *detection* of the
point of onset of spurious pulses as a function of some parameter, for
example counter voltage, and, on the other hand, the *estimation*, that is
the quantitative measurement of a non-negligible component of spurious
pulses in a given pulse train. Since the techniques used for the two situations
are basically similar, and indeed may be identical, it is not always possible
to rigidly maintain such a semantic distinction. The techniques to be
described are, in general, applicable to all pulse detectors but, since
proportional and scintillation counters are the most commonly used
instruments in stem:[4pi] and stem:[4pi]-coincidence counting at the present time,
the techniques are illustrated by reference to these detectors. The cause
of spurious pulses is, in some cases, not well understood and is a field of
investigation in its own right. For this reason there is little discussion of
the possible mechanisms for the production of such pulses except where
the mechanism seems to be well established; a review of the time-interval
distributions of spurious pulses observed in proportional counters has been
recently published <<campion1>>, while those obtained in scintillation detectors
have been discussed by Williams and Smith <<<williams>>.

The total probability for the production of a spurious pulse, or pulses,
per genuine pulse is usually denoted by stem:[theta] and, as so defined, is independent
of the time-interval distribution of spurious pulses. However, only those
spurious pulses which can be detected are of any practical significance,
i.e. only those which occur beyond the end of the dead time {which is
assumed to be non-extendable} and which trigger the discriminator of
the recording system; thus the measurement of the spurious pulses in any
practical situation yields a probability stem:[theta'] which depends on the dead time
{and hence on the shape of the time-interval distribution} and the discrimination
level. In this monograph stem:[theta'] will be tacitly equated with stem:[theta], but
the difference should be noted when comparing measurements of spurious
pulses using different amplifier-discriminator systems.

== Techniques

A simple way to detect the presence of spurious pulses is the method of
plotting the count rate obtained from a detector as a function of the
discriminator bias at a fixed counter voltage or, more usually, as the
voltage is varied for a fixed bias. The length and slope of the resultant
"plateau" are frequently taken to be indicative of satisfactory operation
of detectors, particularly of proportional counters. The length of a plateau
of such a counter is often expressed in terms of the difference in the voltage
applied to the counter at the end and at the beginning of the plateau,
while the slope is described as the percentage rise per unit voltage difference.
These are poor indices of merit since the length expressed in this
way depends on the counter dimensions and particularly on the anode
diameter. A plateau can be readily "lengthened" by increasing the anode
diameter and thus reducing the change in gas gain per unit increase of
counter voltage. A more satisfactory way of expressing the quality of
a plateau is in terms of the ratio of the gas gain at the end of the plateau
to that at the beginning. Yet, in whatever way it is characterized, the "end"
of the plateau is normally taken to indicate the onset of spurious pulses.
This may be a rather naive view since the slope of a plateau could also be
due to spurious pulses as has been demonstrated in the case of Geiger
counters. On the other hand, the slope could result from a genuine increase
in efficiency of the detector. Another elementary method is the visual
observation of an oscilloscope screen but, unless the spurious pulses are
produced with near-constant time intervals relative to the initiating pulse,
it is difficult to detect their presence when stem:[theta] is less than about 0.1.

With the possible exceptions of pulses occurring in Geiger counters and
some pulses in photomultipliers, spurious events in radiation detectors give
rise to very small pulses compared with those due to the majority of genuine
counts from radioactive sources. This, together with the fact that genuine
events normally have a continuous distribution of pulse heights, makes
pulse-height analysis by itself a rather unsatisfactory technique for the
detection and estimation of spurious pulses, especially when one is attempting
to establish the presence or the absence of a very small number of
spurious events. However, there is a notable exception to this generalization.

In the case of stem:[2pi] and stem:[4pi]-proportional counters it has been shown <<lovborg>>
that the observed pulse-height spectrum due to stem:[beta]-particles usually consists
of a broad peak having a high-energy tail and a valley on the low-energy
side as shown in <<fig1>>. This valley arises from, on the one hand, the
natural fall off in the distribution of the number of events with event size
and, on the other hand, the incidence of spurious pulses footnote:[It should be noted that the dead time of the pulse-height analyser may distort the number of spurious pulses in the observed spectrum relative to that of genuine pulses (see <<appendix1>>).]. This fact is the
basis of a technique for detecting spurious pulses which is applicable both
to stem:[4pi]-proportional counters and to Nal(Tl) scintillation detectors used
to assay stem:[beta]-emitters <<houtermans4>>. The count rate from a single-channel pulse-height
analyser, with a window set just above the threshold of the integral discriminator
normally used to obtain a conventional plateau, is observed as
the voltage across the counter is raised. A typical result, obtained for a
^60^Co source in a proportional counter, is shown in <<fig2>> and is compared
with a conventional plateau. The minimum of this pulse-height analyser
curve corresponds to the position of the valley shown in <<fig1>>; at this
point a few spurious pulses are being detected as indicated in <<fig3>>.
This technique is basically more suited to the detection rather than the
estimation of spurious pulses, since any quantitative measurement of the
ratio of spurious to genuine pulses at a given discriminator setting must be
made by extrapolating the component curves, as has been done in <<fig3>>,
and integrating over the appropriate areas; hence the uncertainties of extrapolation
are introduced into the estimation.

Besides pulse height two other closely related properties of spurious pulses
may be invoked in order to detect them. The first is their time relationship
with genuine pulses while the second, in its simplest form, is based on the
fact that most correlated events occur in pairs, i.e. a genuine pulse is
followed by a spurious pulse. It is convenient to subdivide the methods
based on the first property, i.e. the time relationship, into direct techniques,
in which the time-interval distributions are actually recorded, and gating
techniques in which the presence of spurious pulses is inferred from an
analysis of the count rates in suitable intervals of time determined by
electronic gating circuits. Because of the (normally) large difference in
pulse heights between genuine and spurious events, the spurious-to-genuine
sensitivity in most of the techniques described below can be considerably
improved by using appropriate pulse-height selection, but the penalty
incurred by doing so is that it is difficult to make quantitative measurements
of stem:[theta]. However, if it is merely desired to detect the point of onset of
spurious pulses, as a function of detector voltage for example, the combination
of pulse-height analysis with time analysis can be used with
advantage.

=== Direct techniques

In the original method of delayed coincidences <<putman>> one input of a coincidence
circuit is connected directly to a pulse train from a single detector-amplifier
system while the other input is connected to the same pulse train
through a variable de lay. This requires very simple electronic equipment
but is time consuming in operation and hence the statistical precision that
can be achieved is limited. The method can be made more rapid by the use
of a multichannel analyser in the time mode <<genz6>>, <<campion7>>. In this technique
a suitable pulse from the amplifier-discriminator system is used to start
the {internal} clock of the multichannel analyser and all subsequent pulses
are recorded in channels whose addresses are proportional to the time
e lapsed from the start pulse. Thus stem:[theta] is given by the number of correlated
pulses divided by the number of start pulses. The first number is obtained
from the total number of pulses recorded in the relevant channels less the
number of genuine pulses which may be estimated from the (statistically)
flat distribution beyond the end of the time-interval distribution of spurious
pulses. A correction to this procedure may be necessary, depending on
circumstances, to allow for the time interval between adjacent channels,
the so-called "switching time". Some multichannel analysers are completely
insensitive during this time while others allow one, and only one, pulse
to be stored in this period; it is then recorded in the next channel. It is
thus necessary to know the switching time interval and how the analyser
functions. Another correction may be necessary to the second number
(i.e. thd number of start pulses) to take account of those time sweeps
started by spurious pulses (see <<appendix1>>).

The chief disadvantage of the time-mode analyser technique is that most
commercially available multichannel analysers have a channel dwell time
plus switching time of the order of stem:[10" "mu rm(s)] or more, and hence the method
is unsatisfactory for investigating time intervals of less than a few tens of
microseconds. For such situations a time-to-amplitude converter (TAC)
may be used together with a multichannel analyser in the pulse-height mode.
In order to observe time-interval distributions of pulses from a single
detector, it is necessary to feed the same pulse train to both the "start"
and "stop" inputs of the TAC. Hence, in order to avoid the unit starting
and stopping on the *same* pulse, the start pulse must be delayed; the
necessary delay can be found by experiment and is normally less than
a microsecond. Alternatively, a suitable gating system can be arranged.
It must be noted that the TAC system is inherently different from the
previous technique in that random pulses produce an exponential time-interval
distribution because only the first pulse (after a start pulse) is
registered, while the time-mode analyser technique yields a statistically
uniform distribution, neglecting dead-time effects <<muller8>>. However, for
a sufficiently low count rate, the corresponding exponential function
can be regarded as flat over a limited time range. A correction to allow
for the distortion of the observed time-interval distribution of both Poisson
and correlated events, when a time-to-amplitude converter is used at
high rates of data collection, has been described by Coates <<coates9>>, <<coates10>>.
An extension of this technique in which, by means of a second measurement
involving a pulse generator, the corrected time-interval distribution
of the correlated pulses only may be obtained, has been proposed
by Houtermans <<houtermans11>>. The theory, of this technique, as outlined by Houtermans
and modified by Smith <<smith>>, is given in <<appendix2>>. However,
it should be noted that if two or more spurious pulses arise from a single
event then, neglecting genuine pulses, the TAC system will record only
the first spurious pulse and no information can be obtained about the time-interval
distribution of the subsequent spurious pulses without further experimentation;
this is true even for the situation where the overall value of stem:[theta]
is considerably less than unity.

Direct techniques can be used for both detection and estimation but, as
mentioned above, the sensitivity for the former operation can be enhanced
under certain circumstances by the use of pulse-height selection. For
example, by making use of the fact that spurious pulses in proportional
counters are normally much smaller than most pulses due to genuine events,
a pulse-height selector in the "stop" channel will considerably improve
the spurious-to-genuine sensitivity. Alternatively, or additionally, a pulse-height
selector in the start channel will enable time-interval distributions
of spurious pulses following genuine pulses of different heights to be compared.

=== Gating techniques

Gating techniques give no direct information regarding the shape of the
time-interval distribution but serve to quantify the presence or the absence
of spurious pulses from detectors for which the distribution has been assumed
or established by the direct techniques described above. There are at least
three variants of this general method which, for convenience, will be
referred to as gating techniques 1 to 3 in what follows.

==== Subtraction technique

A simple gating technique <<campion13>> consists of counting only those pulses
which occur in an interval of time following a genuine pulse, the electronic
circuits being so arranged that the genuine pulse is not counted within the
gate. The number of counts in such gating intervals may· be measured as
a function of the voltage across the detector. Since at the centres of most
plateaux of proportional counters, for example, the probability of spurious
counts occurring is very small (but see below), the gated count taken
on a plateau will be due to the random events from the radioactive source,
but as soon as the counter voltage is increased to the point where spurious
counts occur, the gated count will increase. A typical example of the use
of this method as applied to a proportional counter is given in <<fig4>> where
the gated count is compared with a conventional plateau plot, using
a gating interval of stem:[25" "mu rm(s)]. A simple calculation shows that the method
can be several orders of magnitude more sensitive in detecting the point
of onset of spurious pulses compared with the normal plateau plot. It will
be seen that this method is the time analogue of the pulse-height technique
of Houtermans et al. <<houtermans4>> described above. A combination of the two
methods, in which only those pulses that fall into both the time interval
and the pulse-height interval are recorded, would undoubtedly make
a powerful technique for the detection of spurious pulses.

image::img06.png[]

As described above the method compares the number of counts in a gating
interval obtained when the detector voltage is set just beyond the plateau
with the number obtained when the voltage is set just on the plateau and
hence is particularly useful for establishing the "end" of a plateau in
a proportional counter. It is not necessary to know the exact length of
the gating interval, the only requirement being that it should remain
constant. However, instead of observing the increase in gated counts as
the voltage is raised, the component of the gated counts due to genuine
pulses can be calculated and subtracted from the observed gated counts
to yield the spurious events. Thus

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
theta = (n_g - <n_g>)//n_o,
++++

where stem:[n_g] is the total number of gated counts recorded in a counting
interval stem:[T], using a gate of length stem:[tau] (which must be longer than the
maximum time interval stem:[tau_s] between a genuine pulse and its associated
spurious pulse(s) ). The expected number of counts due to random events
is stem:[<n_g>] and stem:[n_o] is the total number of times the gate opens in the time
interval stem:[T]. Further, let stem:[n] be the total number of genuine counts in this
interval. If stem:[tau_D] is the minimum time between pulses which can actuate
the gate, then, assuming that all such pulses are due to genuine events,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
<n_g> = n_o^2 tau // [T(1-n_o tau_D//T)].
++++

For the case that stem:[tau_D = tau],

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
<n_g> = n_o^2tau // [T(1-n_o tau//T)];
++++

but for the latter situation

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
n_g + n_o = n(1+theta)
++++

and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
<n_g> = n_o n tau //T = n_o (n_g + n_o) tau // [T(1+theta)].
++++

Equating these two estimates for stem:[<n_g>] gives

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
theta = n_g // n_o - tau(n_g + n_o) // T.
++++

The assumption that stem:[n_o] includes only genuine events is discussed in
<<appendix1>> and is valid if stem:[n tau_s theta//T] is small compared with unity. Thus
the method can be used for the quantitative estimation of stem:[theta] whether
or not the detector gives rise to a plateau. For both techniques it is
essential that the gate width is sufficient to include all the spurious pulses,
although for *detection* a better spurious-to-genuine sensitivity may
sometimes be obtained by selecting a gating interval which excludes
some spurious pulses. In certain circumstances (e. g. for some proportional
counters filled with argon-methane, where most spurious pulses fall in
a peak several hundred microseconds after the initiating pulse) it is
advantageous to use a delayed gating interval.

A variation of this method is to record the pulses from a detector-amplifier-
discriminator system in two scalers, one of which has an appreciably
longer dead time than that in the other channel. Thus, for low
count rates, the difference in the accumulated counts in the two scalers
will be the number of counts that would have been recorded in a gating
interval of length equal to the difference in the two dead times.

==== Correlation technique

A further gating technique involves the principle of correlation counting
<<lewis>> in which any departure from a strictly Poisson distribution of events,
due to the presence of time-correlated spurious counts, can be detected
by a statistical analysis of the counts recorded in gating intervals taken
at random with respect to the pulse train. If measurements are made for
a large number stem:[n_o] of counting intervals each of length stem:[tau], and if stem:[p_i]
genuine pulses and stem:[d_i] spurious pulses occur in the stem:[i]th interval, then
the mean number of observed counts per interval will be

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
m = (n_g)/(n_o) = 1/(n_o) sum_(i=1)^(n_o) (p_i + d_i) = bar(p) + bar(d) = bar(p) (1+theta).
++++

Separating those genuine pulses which do not have associated pulses in
the same interval from those which do, gives

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
p_i = x_i + c_i,
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
d_i = y_i + c_i,
++++

where stem:[x_i] and stem:[y_i] are uncorrelated pulses, and stem:[c_i] is the number of correlated
pairs of pulses footnote:[The numbers stem:[x_i] and stem:[y_i] are only strictly uncorrelated in the absence of dead times.]. Hence the number of pulses in this interval can be written
as stem:[x_i + y_i + 2 c_i]. The expectation value of the variance stem:[v] on the number
of counts per interval, for stem:[n_o] large, is

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
E[v] = v = E[(x_i+y_i+2c_i)^2] - {E[x_i+y_i+2c_i]}^2
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
= E[(x_i+y_i)^2] - {E[x_i + y_i]}^2 + 4E [c_i^2] - 4{E[c_i]}^2
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
= m + 2bar(c),
++++

if stem:[x_i], stem:[x_i] and stem:[c_i] are Poisson distributed.

Here stem:[bar c] represents the mean number of genuine events producing spurious
pulses in the same interval, and it may be expressed

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
bar(c) = bar(p) theta f(lambda, tau),
++++

where stem:[lambda] is some characteristic time constant. As stem:[lambda tau] becomes very large,
stem:[f(lambda, tau)] tends to unity and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
bar(c) = 1/2 (v-m) = bar(p) theta = m theta //(1+theta);
++++

thus

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
theta = (v-m)/(3m-v).
++++


Although the method requires rather sophisticated electronics, it has
applications outside the investigation of spurious pulses (for example,
in the activity measurement of parent-daughter radionuclides) and hence,
for laboratories concerned with radionuclide metrology, the equipment
may be available. However, the method is sensitive to dead-time effects
and to any extraneous fluctuations in the count rate which affect the
observed variance and, further, its practical application is limited to
those situations in which no more than one spurious pulse is associated
with a genuine pulse <<lewis>>.

==== Pulsed source technique

A powerful variant of the general gating technique is to use a pulsed source
of radiation instead of a radioactive source to actuate the detector. The
radiation pulse can be provided by a suitable accelerator, but a much
simpler method is to actuate the detector by means of a discharge lamp.
A small spark discharge in air will produce sufficient ultra-violet
radiation to extract up to several hundred photoelectrons from the cathode
of a proportional counter provided that an appropriately transparent window
can be furnished. The spark is, of course, more than sufficient to actuate
the phototube of a scintillation detector. However, although most spurious
pulses appear to be generated in the phototube, a pulsed accelerator would
test both scintillator and phototube. In its simplest form the method would
involve the recording of the number of pulses produced by the accelerator
or discharge lamp and comparing this with the number of recorded events
from the detector suitably corrected for background due to cosmic rays, etc.
Any excess of the latter number over the former would represent spurious
pulses which were generated in the detector. While pulsed discharge lamps
have been used to examine the shapes of time-interval distributions of
spurious pulses (principally in phototubes), the application of this
technique on a quantitative basis has not been reported, as far as we know.
In the case of the discharge lamp the difficulty lies in demonstrating that
a spark has no inherent spurious radiation at the single-photon level.
However, in principle, the method is by far the most sensitive technique
for detecting the presence of spurious pulses (see below) and, moreover,
the sensitivity is less dependent on the time scale on which spurious pulses
are produced than in the other methods. Solid state gallium arsenide
emitters are reputedly free from inherent after-pulses and are suitable for
testing phototube systems, but it is doubtful whether the wavelength of
the radiation emitted from such devices is sufficiently short to extract
electrons from a proportional counter cathode unless the latter were to be
specially sensitized.

=== Modulo counting technique

A recent technique for the detection of spurious pulses is based on the
fact that most correlated events occur in pairs, i.e. a genuine pulse
is followed by a spurious pulse <<muller15>>, <<muller16>>. Therefore, the total number stem:[n]
of events observed in a given counting interval stem:[tau] can always be decomposed
into pairs and single pulses; thus

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
n = 2 n_("pair") + n_("sing").
++++

As the quality of stem:[n] being even or odd depends exclusively on stem:[n_("sing")],
any measuring method based on "modulo two" counting will only "see"
the unpaired events, permitting the statistical separation of them from
the pulses arriving in pairs. Both stem:[n_("pair")] and stem:[n_("sing")] always form Poisson
processes (with mean rates stem:[N_("pair")] and stem:[N_("sing")], respectively), provided
this was the case for the series of original (parent) events. In general,
the count rates depend on the distribution of the parent-daughter time
intervals. If this is assumed to be exponential with mean stem:[lambda^(-1)], it is found
that

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_("pair") = N epsilon_p epsilon_d theta [1- 1/(lambda tau) (1-e^(-lambda tau))]
++++

and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_("sing") = N{epsilon_p + epsilon_d theta - 2 epsilon_p epsilon_d theta [1- 1/(lambda tau) (1- e^(-lambda tau))]}.
++++

Here stem:[epsilon_p(epsilon_d)] is the detection efficiency for a parent (daughter) pulse, and
stem:[theta] denotes the probability of a spurious pulse being generated.

However, if stem:[lambda tau > > 1], i.e. for sufficiently long counting intervals, the exact
form of the parent-daughter time-interval distribution is irrelevant since
the rates then approach the limiting values

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_("pair") = N epsilon_p epsilon_d theta
++++

and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_("sing") = N(epsilon_p + epsilon_d theta - 2 epsilon_p epsilon_d theta).
++++

A convenient way for determining experimentally the probability for stem:[n]
being even or odd as a function of stem:[tau] consists in using a correlator of the
type first applied by Landaud and Mabboux <<landaud>> for measuring life-times.
As the parity of stem:[n] does not depend on the number of pairs, such a
measurement yields directly stem:[N_("sing")], and for a Poisson distribution:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
"Prob ("n" even") = 1/2 [1+"exp" (-2 N_("sing")tau)].
++++

On the other hand, a simple direct counting of the total pulse train gives

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
N_("tot") = N (epsilon_p + epsilon_d theta) = N_("sing") + 2N_("pair").
++++

Therefore, any significant difference between stem:[N_("tot")] and stem:[N_("sing")] as deduced
from the correlation measurement allows one to determine stem:[N_("pair")], i.e.
the spurious pulse count rate.

The feasibility of this new method has been shown by various checks with
artificial pulse trains <<muller8>>. It can be seen from <<fig5>> how the presence
of spurious pulses modifies the logarithmic plot of the correlation function
stem:[R(tau)], which is here defined as

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
R(tau) = "Prob ("n" even") - "Prob ("n" odd"),
++++

giving

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
R(tau) = { ("exp"[-2 N_("tot")tau],"for "tau < < lambda^(-1)),("exp"[-2(N_("tot")-2N_("pair")tau)],"'' "tau > > lambda^(-1).) :}
++++

In particular, for a fixed delay between parent and daughter pulses, this
change in the exponent occurs suddenly at stem:[tau = lambda^(-1)]. The experiments
suggest that even for a ratio stem:[N_("pair")//N_("tot")] as low as 0.005 the presence
of spurious pulses can still be readily established.

It is also possible to generalize this approach to multiple spurious pulses
<<muller18>>, but for this and for all further details the references indicated
should be consulted.

=== Comparison of techniques

In order to compare the sensitivities of the gating methods 1, 2 and 3 and
the modulo counting technique outlined above, the variance on the
estimate of stem:[theta] for each technique is given in <<table1>> for a counting time stem:[T]
and a genuine pulse rate stem:[N]. These variances are all to some extent
approximate since implicit in their calculation is the assumption that
spurious pulses obey Poisson statistics. Nevertheless, they give a useful
guide for comparison purposes. In <<table1>> two further approximations are
given for the variance depending on whether stem:[theta] is large or small compared
to stem:[Ntau], or its equivalent in the case of method 3. The variance estimate
for the modulo counting technique is taken from <<muller16>>. The requirement
which is often encountered in radionuclide metrology is to establish the
presence or absence of a very small stem:[theta], i.e. stem:[theta < < N tau].

For method 1 two expressions are given for the variance on stem:[theta] corresponding
to the two techniques for handling the data. In calculating the variance for
the first technique (which, as pointed out above, is perhaps more useful
for determining the "end" of a plateau rather than measuring stem:[theta] quantitatively)
it is assumed that the counting time is divided between two readings as
opposed to one reading for the second technique. In practice, of course,
a number of points would be taken along the plateau as shown in <<fig4>>.

For small stem:[theta] values, method 3 (pulsed source technique) is the most sensitive
since the effect of the random nature of the pulses used in the other methods
has been removed. However, considering methods 1 (subtraction technique)
and 2 {correlation technique} alone, it is seen that the variances are comparable,
there being no difference for the case that stem:[theta < < N tau], while for
stem:[theta > >N tau] the variance of method 1 is a factor of 2 smaller. The variance
of both the subtraction and correlation techniques is somewhat smaller than
that of the modulo counting technique because of the restriction on the
value stem:[N tau] in the latter method <<muller16>>.

== Results

=== Proportional counters

Since the subject of time-interval distributions obtained in proportional
counters has been reviewed recently <<campion1>>, only a very brief summary will
be given here. The review has drawn attention to the fact that there is
a wide variation in the shapes of the time-interval distributions as between
one counting gas and another, and, for a given gas, as a function of
pressure and also, in some cases, anode diameter. Further, only two features
of these distributions can be related with any certainty to physical phenomena
known to create free electrons. The first of these is the cathode photoelectric
process; it is of little practical significance since the electronically
imposed dead time is normally sufficient to mask any spurious pulses due
to this effect. However, such pulses may be encountered in situations where
the electron transit time is considerable as, for example, in large high-pressure
proportional counters. The second phenomenon is the ion-cathode
effect; again this is not observed very often, due, in this case, to the fact
that there is, apparently, a relatively low probability associated with this
phenomenon. Thus the majority of spurious pulses are produced by as yet
unidentified processes.

Apart from the photoelectric effect in cylindrical counters, the pulse heights
of spurious pulses correspond to those of single electrons and become apparent
towards the end of a plateau when the latter is obtained for a typical
stem:[beta]-emitter. Hence the few measurements that have been made at the centres
of plateau show no evidence for spurious pulses. However, the generalization
of this statement to all plateaux should be made with a certain amount of
caution for the following reasons. Firstly, the "centre" of a plateau is not
a well defined point. Secondly, the length of a plateau region is dependent
to some extent on the energy of the stem:[beta]-radiation. Starting with the count-rate
characteristic due to a single electron, the "plateau" will lengthen
as the number of primary electrons increases, i.e. as the energy of the
incident ~-particles increases, until their energy is such that most tracks
cross the counter. Any further increase in the stem:[beta]-particle energy will have
little effect on the length of the plateau. Thus it will depend on how
close the "centre" of the plateau is to the point at which single electrons
can be detected as to whether significant numbers of spurious pulses will
be recorded. In this respect the response of the proportional counter
to single electrons should be considered. The pulse-height spectrum for
single electrons varies between an exponential for low gas gains and a
distribution having a more or less pronounced peak for high gas gains.
The shape of single-electron spectra varies considerably with experimental
conditions (see, for example, the recent review by Genz <<genz19>> and
<<fig6>> compares the exponential distribution

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
f_e(E) = 1/m e^(-E//m)
++++

with a strongly peaked Pólya-type distribution

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
f_p(E) = (4E)/(m^2) e^(-2E//m),
++++

where stem:[m] is the mean of the distribution in both cases. In practice most
single-electron spectra will lie somewhere between these two distributions.

[[fig6]]
.Theoretical single-electron pulse-height distributions. The mean of both distributions is stem:[m].
image::img08.png[]

<<fig6>> shows that, for a discriminator set at a level corresponding to
about two or more electrons, fewer single electrons, and hence fewer
spurious pulses, will be recorded if the second rather than the first
distribution is applicable. Some recent work <<campion20>> has indicated that for
many counting gases it may not be possible to detect single electrons without
incurring some spurious pulses, the number varying considerably with the
gas and, further, that there is a significant probability that some events
produce more than one spurious pulse even although the mean stem:[theta] may be
considerably less than unity.

=== Scintillation counters

A review of spurious pulses in scintillation counters has been given by
Williams and Smith <<williams>>. In such detectors, spurious pulses may arise either
in the phototube and its envelope or in the scintillator and its container;
the relative importance of these two sources evidently varies between
detector systems <<williams>>, <<houtermans21>>.

The time-interval distribution of spurious pulses generated in the phototube
depends to a certain extent on the design of the tube. Two examples of
observed distributions are shown in <<fig7>> and <<fig8>>. The structure at short
time intervals in these distributions is due to ions of residual gas molecules
striking the photocathode <<morton>>. These ions are created in the space between
the cathode and first dynode and, owing to the nature of the electric field
in this region, the transit time is almost independent of the point of origin
of the ions. Ions may be created in other parts of the phototube <<coates23>> but
these have considerably less chance of reaching the photocathode and, if
the interaction of such ions with a dynode surface should produce an
electron, the effect is progressively less significant the further down the
dynode chain the interaction takes place. Some ions, notably H~2~^\+^ and He^+^,
may cause the simultaneous release of up to 20 electrons per incident ion
on the photocathode. Thus spurious pulses due to this effect may be larger
than the genuine pulse which caused them.

Other spurious pulses may be due to light generated within the phototube
<<krall>> and have a pulse height equivalent to a single photoelectron pulse.
Effects which cause such spurious pulses include

. [[eff-a]] electrode glow and
. [[eff-b]] faceplate phosphorescence initiated either by Cerenkov radiation
or direct excitation by ionizing radiations.

Effect <<eff-a>> occurs when the phototube is operated at high gain (stem:[>= 10^9] say)
when light emitted from the anode and last few dynodes is scattered back
to the photocathode. This gives rise to a spurious pulse at one electron
transit time through the phototube, i.e. in less than about 50 ns. It is more
usual to operate phototubes at much lower gains when the effect is absent,

[[fig7]]
.Time-interval distribution of spurious pulses in a phototube type 56 DUVP (from <<smith>>).

[[fig8]]

image::img10.png[]

and, in any case, modern phototubes are well baffled so that light from
this source does not reach the photocathode. The second effect may be
due to Cerenkov radiation emitted by relativistic particles (e.g. Compton
scattered electrons from high energy stem:[gamma]-rays) traversing the glass envelope.
The Cerenkov radiation can then interact with the photocathode to produce
a pulse. If the phototube is part of a scintillation detector, this pulse
will be coincident with, and add to, the main pulse due to light from the
scintillator itself. However, it has been shown that such pulses can be
accompanied by several smaller pulses occurring up to several tens of
microseconds afterwards. An explanation put forward <<jerde>> is that the blue
light of the Cerenkov radiation excites phosphorescence in the glass
faceplate which, as the excited states subsequently decay, emits visible
radiation. However, another investigation, while confirming the effect,
has cast doubt on this explanation and an alternative mechanism in which
the effect is due to direct excitation of the electrons in the solid has been
put forward <<dressler>>. An extensive study of three phototubes having a gallium
arsenide first dynode has confirmed the existence of spurious pulses due to
ions and to the interaction of energetic radiation with the face plate in
this type of phototube <<coates23>>, <<coates27>>.

[[fig9]]

image::img11.png[]

Spurious pulses caused by the decay of excited states in the faceplates
are probably single-electron events. However, it is an oversimplification
to assume that all spurious pulses in the tails of the time-interval distributions
in <<fig7>> and <<fig8>> are single photoelectron pulses; there is in fact
a distribution of event size. The explanation is probably that "ion pulses"
are produced as a result of spurious single-electron events.

Liquid and plastic scintillators together with most glasses phosphoresce
after exposure to strong light and hence it is advisable to keep such materials
in darkness or red light for several hours before using them. Because of
these phosphorescent properties there is always the possibility that spurious
pulses, due to phosphorescence induced by the light generated by a genuine
pulse or due to direct excitation, may occur. Houtermans <<houtermans21>> has
published a time-interval distribution (reproduced in <<fig9>> obtained
with a complete scintillation detector and concludes that, since a significant
difference was found between the shapes obtained using liquid and plastic
scintillators, some spurious pulses originate in the scintillator itself.
However, in general, this aspect has received rather little attention to date.

== Conclusion

It is clear that an experimenter should be aware of the possibility of
spurious pulses in any counting system, but it is also evident that spurious
pulses are not likely to be a serious source of error in most well-designed
counting experiments for the measurement of stem:[beta]-emitters, except possibly
those involving liquid scintillation counters. With one or two provisos
the usual practice of operating a proportional counter near the centre of
the plateau is probably sound. It is however advisable to check, using one
of the methods described above, for the existence of spurious pulses from
time to time and especially when any new or unusual measurement is
undertaken. One such situation may be the use of large high-pressure
proportional counters.

In scintillation counting the situation is satisfactory for Nal(Tl) systems
unless one is working at extremely low stem:[gamma]-ray energies. But perhaps the
most critical situation is in the use of liquid scintillation counting for
absolute measurements of low energy stem:[beta]-emitters. Here the light output is
small and therefore the pulse heights of spurious events are more comparable
with those of genuine pulses. Thus there is a significant possibility of
spurious pulses and the use of liquid scintillators as stem:[4pi beta]-detectors at the
present time is limited largely by this phenomenon <<houtermans28>>. The use of two
phototubes in coincidence will substantially reduce the number of spurious
pulses detected but the overall efficiency is also reduced.

[[appendix1]]
== The influence of an imposed dead time on the detection of subsequent spurious pulses

Many of the methods described in the text for the estimation of stem:[theta] involve
the recording of the number of times a detecting circuit is actuated.
This circuit may be, for example, a gate, a time-to-amplitude converter
or an analyser in either the pulse-height or time mode. In such methods
it is assumed that the circuit is actuated by genuine pulses only; this
assumption is usually justified by the fact that the value of stem:[theta] is very much
less than unity. Here the validity of this assumption will be examined.

The problem may be stated in the following way: given a pulse train,
composed of both genuine and spurious pulses, which is detected by
a circuit, the overall dead time of which is longer than the maximum time
interval between a genuine pulse and its associated spurious pulse{s),
what is the probability that the circuit will be actuated by a spurious
pulse?

Let stem:[f(tau)] be the density for the time interval between a genuine and
a spurious pulse and stem:[tau_s] the maximum value of this interval (<<fig10>>).

[[fig10]]
.a) A hypothetical interval density stem:[f(tau)] of spurious pulses as a function of time interval stem:[tau]. b) A sketch illustrating the relationship of the density stem:[f(tau)] with respect to events in real time stem:[t].
image::img12.png[]

The circuit, of dead time stem:[tau_D], is actuated at time stem:[t = tau_s - tau_D] and it is
immaterial whether the actuating pulse is genuine or spurious. Time stem:[t = 0]
is taken at a point stem:[tau_s] before the end of the dead time since, neglecting
second order spurious pulses, only genuine pulses in the interval stem:[t = 0] to
stem:[tau_s] can produce a spurious pulse, which must fall in the interval stem:[t = tau_s]
to stem:[2tau_s]. The next pulse after the end of the dead time up to stem:[t = 2 tau_s]
may be spurious or genuine, or there may be no pulse. However, in the
last case, the next pulse to arrive must be genuine. Hence, if the count
rate of genuine pulses is stem:[N], then the probability stem:[P_s] that the next pulse
after the end of the dead time is spurious is

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
P_s = int_0^(tau_s) N theta "d"t int_(tau_s - tau)^(tau_s) f(tau) e^(-N(tau - tau_s + t)) "d" tau.
++++

The evaluation of this requires a knowledge of the shape of the time-interval
density stem:[f(tau)], and, as noted in the text, this may vary considerably
from one case to another. However, by way of an example, assume that
stem:[f(tau)] is constant for stem:[tau <= tau_s] and equal to stem:[1//tau_s]. Then

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
P_s = theta[1- (1-e^(-N tau_s))//N tau_s].
++++

As stem:[N tau_s] increases to large values, stem:[P_s] tends to stem:[theta], while for small values of stem:[N tau_s] for this particular case, stem:[P_s] tends to stem:[N tau_s theta//2]. In general stem:[P_s=a theta],
where stem:[a] is some function of stem:[N] and stem:[tau_s] while the probability stem:[P_g] that the
next pulse is genuine is stem:[P_g = 1 - a theta].

Thus the assumption that all actuating counts are genuine is only incorrect
by a factor stem:[(1 - a theta)]; by using a sufficiently low count rate the departure
of this factor from unity may be made insignificant, *independently* of the
value of stem:[theta]. Thus for most situations, especially where stem:[theta] is also small,
the assumption is a valid one.

[[appendix2]]
== The elimination of genuine pulses from time-interval distributions obtained by the time-to-amplitude converter technique

The time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) system can usually be arranged
such that every start pulse gives rise to one recorded stop pulse. In the
event that the next pulse after a start pulse occurs at a time greater than
the range of the TAC system, the pulse may be recorded in an "overflow"
channel. Let stem:[n_s] be the total number of start pulses and stem:[n(t)] the recorded
time-interval distribution. Then the probability stem:[S(t)] that no stop pulse
arrives earlier than stem:[t] is given by

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
S(t) = 1/(n_s) int_t^(oo) n(t) "d"t = 1 - 1/(n_s) int_0^t n(t) "d"t,
++++

since

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
n_s = int_0^(oo) n(t) "d"t;
++++

thus

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
n(t) "d"t = -n_s "d"/("d"t) S(t) "d"t.
++++

The stop pulses may be genuine, or spurious and time correlated to the
start pulse, or spurious but arising from a genuine pulse occurring before
the start pulse (i.e. not correlated with the start pulse). The three types
will be indicated by the subscripts stem:[r], stem:[c] and stem:[a], respectively. Thus,
neglecting the influence of dead times,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
S(t) = S_r(t) * S_c(t) * S_a(t).
++++

However, the probability differential stem:[C(t)" d"t] for the spurious pulses,
which would be observed in the absence of all genuine events (except
for the start), would be stem:[-d S_c(t)], i.e.

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
C(t) = -"d"/("d"t) S_c(t) = -"d"/("d"t) [(S(t))/(S_r(t)*S_a(t))],
++++

and hence

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
theta = - int_0^(oo) "d"/"d"t [(S(t))/(S_r(t)*S_a(t))] "d"t.
++++

The probability stem:[S(t)] can be readily determined from the observed time-interval
distribution and stem:[S_r(t)]. In a similar manner, stem:[S_a(t)] can be obtained
from a subsidiary experiment in which a pulse generator is used to start
the TAC system.
