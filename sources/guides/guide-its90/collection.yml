  The official publication of the International Temperature Scale of
  1990 (ITS-90) gives a concise definition of temperatures T90 and
  is highly prescriptive. To accompany the text, supplementary
  information concerning the practical realization of the scale was
  published in 1990 by the BIPM in a monograph entitled
  Supplementary Information for the ITS-90; this monograph provided
  the non-prescriptive details in a comprehensive form.

  A first revision of the initial edition was completed in 2018 and
  takes into account the progress in thermometry that have been
  achieved since 1990 concerning both temperature fixed points and
  interpolation instruments. The new edition has been drafted by the
  CCT Task Group for the Realization of the Kelvin (CCT-TG-K) and
  each chapter has been approved by the Consultative Committee for
  Thermometry.

  This new edition, _Guide to the Realization of the ITS-90_, is
  published uniquely in electronic form on the BIPM website. The
  chapters are self-contained but harmonized allowing a higher
  flexibility for future revisions to follow the pace of new
  developments. The presented material could be assembled only
  thanks to the continual assistance of many colleagues in the
  temperature-measurement community.

  There are many sources of information which requires a subjective
  selection of the references and unintentional errors of omission
  are certainly inevitable; comments and proposals for future
  revisions are most welcome.
