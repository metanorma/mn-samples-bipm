// :title-en: The Provisional Low Temperature Scale from stem:[0.9 "unitsml(mK)"] to stem:[1 "unitsml(K)"], PLTS-2000

== The scale

The scale is defined by the following equation relating the melting pressure stem:[p] of ^3^He to temperature stem:[ii(T)_{2000}]:

== Background to the PLTS-2000

The melting pressure of ^3^He was chosen as the property on which the extension of the ITS-90 should be based because of the sensitivity and reliability with which it may be measured over a wide range (covering more than three decades of temperature) apart from a narrow region around the pressure minimum at stem:[315.24 "unitsml(mK)"] (see <<fig1>>). The pressure minimum itself has the compensating advantage of providing a convenient pressure fixed point for calibrating the pressure transducer (the pressure must be measured using a transducer _in situ_ because for temperatures below the minimum a sensing line will be blocked with solid ^3^He and the cell is therefore isolated).

The pressure minimum is one of four natural features which may be located and used as fixed points of pressure and temperature, the others being the transition to the superfluid 'A' phase, the 'A to B' transition in the superfluid and the Néel transition in the solid. The pressure and temperature values of these four points on the PLTS-2000 are:


[cols="3*",options="unnumbered"]
|===
h| Point h| stem:[p//"unitsml(MPa)"] h| stem:[ii(T)_{2000}//"unitsml(mK)"]
| minimum | stem:[2.93113] | stem:[315.24]
| A | stem:[3.43407] | stem:[2.444]
| A-B | stem:[3.43609] | stem:[1.896]
| Néel | stem:[3.43934] | stem:[0.902]

The standard uncertainty of the scale in thermodynamic terms is estimated to be stem:[0.5 "unitsml(mK)"] down to stem:[500 "unitsml(mK)"], decreasing linearly to stem:[0.2 "unitsml(mK)"] at stem:[100 "unitsml(mK)"]. It decreases further with falling temperature, but in percentage terms it increases to about stem:[0.3 %] of stem:[ii(T)] at stem:[25 "unitsml(mK)"] and stem:[2 %] of stem:[ii(T)] at stem:[0.9 "unitsml(mK)"]. The standard uncertainties in the absolute pressures are estimated to be about stem:[60 "unitsml(Pa)"] (in about stem:[3 "unitsml(MPa)"]).
