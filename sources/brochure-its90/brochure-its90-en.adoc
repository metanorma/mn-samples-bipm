== Abstract

It should be noted that the official version of the scale is the French one.
The English version, published for convenience, has been authorized by the
Comité Consultatif de Thermométrie and approved by the Comité International
des Poids et Mesures.

The International Temperature Scale of 1990 was adopted by the
Comité International des Poids et Mesures at its meeting in 1989, in
accordance with the request embodied in Resolution 7 of the [8th
Conference Générale des Poids et Mesures of 1987. This scale supersedes
the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (amended edition
of 1975) and the 1976 Provisional stem:[0.5 " "rm(K)] to stem:[30 " "rm(K)] Temperature Scale.


== Units of temperature

The unit of the fundamental physical quantity known as thermo-dynamic temperature, symbol stem:[ii(T)],
is the kelvin, symbol stem:[rm(K)], defined as the fraction stem:[1//273.16] of the thermodynamic temperature of
the triple point of water footnote:[Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Treizième Conférence Générale des Poids et
Mesures (1967-1968), Resolutions 3 and 4, p. 104,].

Because of the way earlier temperature scales were defined, it remains
common practice to express a temperature in terms of its difference
from stem:[273.15 " "rm(K)], the ice point. A thermodynamic temperature, stem:[T], expressed
in this way is known as a Celsius temperature, symbol stem:[t], defined by:


[[eq1]]
[stem]
++++
t//rm(°C) = ii(T)//rm(K) - 273.15 .
++++


The unit of Celsius temperature is the degree Celsius, symbol °C,
which is by definition equal in magnitude to the kelvin. A difference
of temperature may be expressed in kelvins or degrees Celsius.

The International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) defines both
International Kelvin Temperatures, symbol stem:[ii(T)_{90}], and International Celsius
Temperatures, symbol stem:[ii(T)_{90}]. The relation between stem:[ii(T)_{90}] and stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is the same
as that between stem:[ii(T)] and stem:[t], i.e.:

[[eq2]]
[stem]
++++
t_{90}//rm(°C) = ii(T)_{90}//rm(K) - 273.15 .
++++


The unit of the physical quantity stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is the kelvin, symbol stem:[rm(K)], and the unit of the physical quantity stem:[t_{90}] is the degree Celsius, symbol stem:[rm(°C)], as is the case for the thermodynamic temperature stem:[ii(T)] and the Celsius temperature stem:[t].


== Principles of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90)

The ITS-90 extends upwards from stem:[0.65 " "rm(K)] to the highest temperature
practicably measurable in terms of the Planck radiation law using
monochromatic radiation. The ITS-90 comprises a number of ranges
and sub-ranges throughout each of which temperatures stem:[ii(T)_{90}] are defined.
Several of these ranges or sub-ranges overlap, and where such overlapping
occurs, differing definitions of stem:[ii(T)_{90}] exist: these differing definitions have
equal status. For measurements of the very highest precision there may
be detectable numerical differences between measurements made at the
same temperature but in accordance with differing definitions. Similarly,
even using one definition, at a temperature between defining fixed points
two acceptable interpolating instruments (e.g. resistance thermometers)
may give detectably differing numerical values of stem:[ii(T)_{90}]. In virtually all
cases these differences are of negligible practical importance and are at
the minimum level consistent with a scale of no more than reasonable
complexity: for further information on this point, see «&nbsp;Supplementary
Information for the ITS-90&nbsp;» footnote:[See Monography BIPM/1990.].

The ITS-90 has been constructed in such a way that, throughout
its range, for any given temperature the numerical value of stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is a
close approximation to the numerical value of stem:[ii(T)] according to best
estimates at the time the scale was adopted. By comparison with direct
measurements of thermodynamic temperatures, measurements of stem:[ii(T)_{90}] are
more easily made, are more precise and are highly reproducible.

There are significant numerical differences between the values of stem:[ii(T)_{90}]
and the corresponding values of stem:[ii(T)_{68}] measured on the International
Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68), see <<fig1>> and <<table6>>.
Similarly there were differences between the IPTS-68 and the International
Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48), and between the

International Temperature Scale of 1948 (ITS-48) and the International
Temperature Scale of 1927 (ITS-27). See the Appendix and, for more
detailed information, «&nbsp;Supplementary Information for the ITS-90&nbsp;».


== Definition of the International Temperature Scale of 1990

Between stem:[0.65 " "rm(K)] and stem:[5.0 " "rm(K)] stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined in terms of the vapour-pressure
temperature relations of ^3^He and ^4^He.

Between stem:[3.0 " "rm(K)] and the triple point of neon (stem:[24.5561 " "rm(K)]) stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined
by means of a helium gas thermometer calibrated at three experimentally
realizable temperatures having assigned numerical values (defining fixed
points) and using specified interpolation procedures.

Between the triple point of equilibrium hydrogen (stem:[13.8033 " "rm(K)]) and
the freezing point of silver (stem:[961.78 " "rm(°C)]) stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined by means of
platinum resistance thermometers calibrated at specified sets of defining
fixed points and using specified interpolation procedures.

Above the freezing point of silver (stem:[961.78 " "rm(°C)]) stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined in terms
of a defining fixed point and the Planck radiation law.

The defining fixed points of the ITS-90 are listed in <<table1>>. The
effects of pressure, arising from significant depths of immersion of the
sensor or from other causes, on the temperature of most of these points
are given in <<table2>>.


[[scls_3-1]]
=== From stem:[0.65 " "rm(K)] to stem:[5.0 " "rm(K)]: helium vapour-pressure temperature equations

In this range stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined in terms of the vapour pressure stem:[p] of ^3^He and ^4^He using equations of the form:


[[eq3]]
[stem]
++++
ii(T)_{90}//rm(K) = ii(A)_0 + sum_{i=1}^9 ii(A)_i [(ln (p//rm(Pa)) — ii(B))//ii(C)]^i .
++++


The values of the constants stem:[ii(A)_0], stem:[ii(A)_i], stem:[ii(B)] and stem:[ii(C)] are given in <<table3>>
for ^3^He in the range of stem:[0.65 " "rm(K)] to stem:[3.2 " "rm(K)], and for ^4^He in the ranges
stem:[1.25 " "rm(K)] to stem:[2.1768 " "rm(K)] (the stem:[ii(lambda)] point) and stem:[2.1768 " "rm(K)] to stem:[5.0 " "rm(K)].


[[scls_3-2]]
=== From stem:[3.0 " "rm(K)] to the triple point of neon (stem:[24.5561 " "rm(K)]): gas thermometer

In this range stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined in terms of a ^3^He or a ^4^He gas
thermometer of the constant-volume type that has been calibrated at
three temperatures. These are the triple point of neon (stem:[24.5561 " "rm(K)]), the
triple point of equilibrium hydrogen (stem:[13.8033 " "rm(K)]), and a temperature
between stem:[30 " "rm(K)] and stem:[5.0 " "rm(K)]. This last temperature is determined using a
^3^He or a ^4^He vapour pressure thermometer as specified in <<scls_3-1>>.

==== From stem:[4.2 " "rm(K)] to the triple point of neon (stem:[24.5561 " "rm(K)]) with ^4^He as the thermometric gas

In this range stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined by the relation:

[[eq4]]
[stem]
++++
ii(T)_{90} = a + b p + c p^2 .
++++

where stem:[p] is the pressure in the gas thermometer and stem:[a], stem:[b] and stem:[c] are
coefficients the numerical values of which are obtained from measurements
made at the three defining fixed points given in <<scls_3-2>>, but with the
further restriction that the lowest one of these points lics between stem:[4.2 " "rm(K)]
and stem:[5.0 " "rm(K)],


==== From stem:[3.0 " "rm(K)] to the triple point of neon (stem:[24.5561 " "rm(K)]) with ^3^He or ^4^He as the thermometric gas

For a ^3^He gas thermometer, and for a ^4^He gas thermometer used
below stem:[4.2 " "rm(K)], the non-ideality of the gas must be accounted for explicitly,
using the appropriate second virial coefficient stem:[ii(B)_3 (ii(T)_{90})] or stem:[ii(B)_4 (ii(T)_{90})]. In this
tange stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined by the relation:

[[eq5]]
[stem]
++++
ii(T)_{90} = {a + b p + c p^2} / {1 + ii(B)_x (ii(T)_{90}) ii(N)//ii(V)} ,
++++


where stem:[p] is the pressure in the gas thermometer, stem:[a], stem:[b] and stem:[c] are coefficients the numerical values of which are obtained from measurements at three defining temperatures as given in <<scls_3-2>>, stem:[ii(N)//ii(V)] is the gas density with stem:[N] being the quantity of gas and stem:[ii(V)] the volume of the bulb, stem:[x] is 3 or 4 according to the isotope used, and the values of the second virial coefficients are given by the relations:

For ^3^He,

[[eq6a]]
[stem,subsequence=A]
++++
ii(B)_3 (ii(T)_{90})//rm(m)^3" "rm(mol)^{-1} = {16.69 - 336.98 (ii(T)_{90}//rm(K))^{-1} + 91.04 (ii(T)_{90}//rm(K))^{-2} - 13.82(ii(T)_{90}//rm(K))^{-3}} 10^{-6} .
++++


For ^4^He,


[stem%unnumbered]
++++
ii(B)_4 (ii(T)_{90})//rm(m)^3" "rm(mol)^{-1} = {16.708 - 374.05 (ii(T)_{90}//rm(K))^{-1} - 383.53 (ii(T)_{90}//rm(K))^{-2} - 1799.2(ii(T)_{90}//rm(K))^{-3}
++++

[[eq6b]]
[stem,subsequence=A]
++++
- 4033.2(ii(T)_{90}//rm(K))^{-4} - 3252.8(ii(T)_{90}//rm(K))^{-5}} 10^{-6} .
++++

The accuracy with which stem:[ii(T)_{90}] can be realized using <<eq4>> and <<eq5>>
depends on the design of the gas thermometer and the gas density
used, Design criteria and current good practice required to achieve a
selected accuracy are given in «&nbsp;Supplementary Information for the
ITS-90&nbsp;».


=== The triple point of equilibrium hydrogen (stem:[13.8033 " "rm(K)]) to the freezing point of silver (stem:[961.78 " "rm(°C)]): platinum resistance thermometer

In this range stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is defined by means of a platinum resistance
thermometer calibrated at specified sets of defining fixed points, and
using specified reference and deviation functions for interpolation at
intervening temperatures.

No single platinum resistance thermometer can provide high accuracy,
or is even likely to be usable, over all of the temperature range
stem:[13.8033 " "rm(K)] to stem:[961.78 " "rm(°C)]. The choice of temperature range, or ranges,
from among those listed below for which a particular thermometer can
be used is normally limited by its construction.

For practical details and current good practice, in particular
concerning types of thermometer available, their acceptable operating
ranges, probable accuracies, permissible leakage resistance, resistance
values, and thermal treatment, see «&nbsp;Supplementary Information for the
ITS-90&nbsp;». It is particularly important to take account of the appropriate
heat treatments that should be followed cach time a platinum resistance
thermometer is subjected to a temperature above about stem:[420 " "rm(°C)].

Temperatures are determined in terms of the ratio of the resistance stem:[ii(R)(ii(T)_{90})] at a temperature stem:[ii(T)_{90}], and the resistance stem:[ii(R)(273.16 " "rm(K))] at the triple point of water. This ratio, stem:[ii(W)(ii(T)_{90})], is footnote:[Note that this definition of stem:[ii(W)(ii(T)_{90})] differs from the corresponding definition used in the ITS-27, ITS-48, [PTS-48 and IPTS-68: for all of these curlier scales stem:[ii(W)(ii(T))] was defined in terms of a reference temperature of stem:[0" "rm(°C)], which since 1954 has itself been delined as stem:[273.15 " "rm(K)].]:


[[eq7]]
[stem]
++++
ii(W)(ii(T)_{90}) = ii(R)(ii(T)_{90})//ii(R)(273.16 " "rm(K)).
++++


An acceptable plalinum resistance thermometer must be made from
pure, strain-free platinum, and it must satisfy at least one of the
following two relations;

[[eq8a]]
[stem,subsequence=B]
++++
ii(W)(29.7646 " "rm(°C)) >= 1.11807,
++++

[[eq8b]]
[stem,subsequence=B]
++++
ii(W)(-38.8344 " "rm(°C)) <= 0.844235,
++++


An acceptable platinum resistance thermometer that is to be used
up to the freezing point of silver must also satisfy the relation;

[[eq8c]]
[stem,subsequence=B]
++++
ii(W)(961.78 " "rm(°C)) >= 4.2844.
++++


In cach of the resistance thermometer ranges, stem:[ii(T)_{90}] is obtained from
stem:[ii(W)_r (ii(T)_{90})] as given by the appropriate reference function {<<eq9b>> or
<<eq10b>>}, and the deviation stem:[ii(W)(ii(T)_{90}) - ii(W)_r (ii(T)_{90})]. At the defining fixed points
this deviation is obtained directly from the calibration of the thermometer;
at intermediate temperatures it is obtained by means of the appropriate
deviation function {<<eq12>>, <<eq13>> and <<eq14>>}.

. For the range stem:[13.8033 " "rm(K)] to stem:[273.16 " "rm(K)] the following reference function is defined:
+
--

[[eq9a]]
[stem,subsequence=C]
++++
ln[ii(W)_r (ii(T)_{90})] = ii(A)_0 + sum_{i=1}^{12} ii(A)_i [{ln(ii(T)_{90}//273.16 " "rm(K)) + 1.5} / 1.5]^i .
++++

An inverse function, equivalent to <<eq9a>> to within stem:[0.1 " "rm(mK)], is:

[[eq9b]]
[stem,subsequence=C]
++++
ii(T)_{90}//273.16 " "rm(K) = ii(B)_0 + sum_{i=1}^{15} ii(B)_i [{ii(W)_r(ii(T)_{90})^{1//6} - 0.65}/0.35]^i .
++++

The values of the constants stem:[ii(A)_0], stem:[ii(A)_i], stem:[ii(B)_0] and stem:[ii(B)_i] are given in <<table4>>.

A thermometer may be calibrated for use throughout this range or,
using progressively fewer calibration points, for ranges with low
temperature limits of stem:[24.5561 " "rm(K)], stem:[54.3584 " "rm(K)] and stem:[83.8058 " "rm(K)], all having
an upper limit of stem:[273.16 " "rm(K)].
--

. For the range stem:[0 " "rm(°C)] to stem:[961.78 " "rm(°C)] the following reference function
is defined:
+
--

[[eq10a]]
[stem,subsequence=D]
++++
ii(W)_r(ii(T)_{90}) = ii(C)_0 + sum_{i=1}^9 ii(C)_i [{ii(T)_{90}//rm(K) - 754.15}/481]^i
++++

An inverse function, equivalent to <<eq10a>> to within stem:[0.13 " "rm(mK)], is:

[[eq10b]]
[stem,subsequence=D]
++++
ii(T)_{90}//rm(K) - 273.15 = D_0 + sum_{i=1}^9 ii(D)_i [{ii(W)_r(ii(T)_{90}) - 2.64}/1.64]^i .
++++

The values of the constants stem:[ii(C)_0], stem:[ii(C)_i], stem:[ii(D)_0] and stem:[ii(D)_i], are given in <<table4>>.

A thermometer may be calibrated for use throughout this range or, using fewer calibration points, for ranges with upper limits of stem:[660.323 " "rm(°C)],
stem:[419.527 " "rm(°C)], stem:[231.928 " "rm(°C)], stem:[156.5985 " "rm(°C)] or stem:[29.7646 " "rm(°C)], all having a lower limit of stem:[0 " "rm(°C)].

== Supplementary information and differences from earlier scales

The apparatus, methods and procedures that will serve to realize
the ITS-90 are given in «&nbsp;Supplementary Information for the ITS-90&nbsp;»,
This document also gives an account of the carlier International
Temperature Scales and the numerical differences between successive
scales that include, where practicable, mathematical functions for the
differences stem:[ii(T)_{90} - ii(T)_{68}]. A number of useful approximations to the ITS-90
are given in «&nbsp;Techniques for Approximating the ITS-90&nbsp;» footnote:[See Monography BIPM/1990.].

The two documents have been prepared by the Comité Consultatif
de Thermométrie and are published by the BIPM; they are revised and
updated periodically.

The differences stem:[ii(T)_{90} - ii(T)_{68}] are shown in <<fig1>> and <<table6>>. The
number of significant figures given in <<table6>> allows smooth interpolations
to be made. However, the reproducibility of the IPTS-68 is, in
many areas, substantially worse than is implied by this number.

=== The International Temperature Scale of 1927 (ITS-27)

The International Temperature Scale of 1927 was adopted by the,
seventh Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures to overcome the
practical difficulties of the direct realization of thermodynamic temperatures
by gas thermometry, and as a universally acceptable replacement
for the differing existing national temperature scales. The ITS-27 was
formulated so as to allow measurements of temperature to be made
precisely and reproducibly, with as close an approximation to thermodynamic
temperatures as could be determined at that time. Between the
oxygen boiling point and the gold freezing point it was based upon a
number of reproducible temperatures, or fixed points, to which numerical
values were assigned, and two standard interpolating instruments. Each
of these interpolating instruments was calibrated at several of the fixed
points. this giving the constants for the interpolating formula in the
appropriate temperature range. A platinum resistance thermometer was
used for the lower part and a platinum rhodium/platinum thermocouple
for temperatures above stem:[660 " "rm(°C)]. For the region above the gold freezing
point, temperatures were defined in terms of the Wien radiation law:
in practice, this invariably resulted in the selection of an optical
pyrometer as the realizing instrument.


=== The International Temperature Scale of 1948 (ITS-48)

The International Temperature Scale of 1948 was adopted by the
ninth Conférence Générale. Changes from the ITS-27 were: the lower
limit of the platinum resistance thermometer range was changed from
stem:[-190" "rm(°C)]to the defined oxygen boiling point of stem:[-182.97 " "rm(°C)], and the
junction of the platinum resistance thermometer range and the
thermocouple range became the measured antimony freezing point (about
stem:[630 " "rm(°C)]) in place of stem:[660 " "rm(°C)]; the silver freezing: point was defined as
being stem:[960.8 " "rm(°C)] instead of stem:[960.5 " "rm(°C)]; the gold freezing point replaced the
gold melting point (stem:[1063 " "rm(°C)]); the Planck radiation law replaced the
Wien law; the value assigned to the second radiation constant became
stem:[1.438 xx 10^{-2} " m" cdot rm(K)] in place of stem:[1.432 xx 10^{-2} " "rm(m)* rm(K)]; the permitted ranges
for the constants of the interpolation formulae for the standard resistance
thermometer and thermocouple were modified; the limitation on stem:[ii(lambda) ii(T)] for
optical pyrometry (stem:[ii(lambda) ii(T) <= 3 xx 10^{-3} " "rm(m) * rm(K)]) was changed to the requirement
that «&nbsp;visible&nbsp;» radiation be used.


=== The International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (Amended Edition of 1960) (IPTS-48)

The International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948, amended
edition of 1960, was adopted by the eleventh Conférence Générale: the
tenth Conférence Générale had already adopted the triple point of water
as the sole point defining the kelvin, the unit of thermodynamic
temperature. In addition to the introduction of the word «&nbsp;Practical&nbsp;»,
the modifications to the JTS-48 were: the triple point of water, defined
as being stem:[0.01 " "rm(°C)], replaced the melting point of ice as the calibration’
point in this region; the freezing point of zinc, defined as being
stem:[419.505 " "rm(°C)], became a preferred alternative to the sulphur boiling point
(stem:[444.6 " "rm(°C)]) as a calibration point; the permitted ranges for the constants
of the interpolation formulae for the standard resistance thermometer
and the thermocouple were further modified; the restriction to «&nbsp;visible&nbsp;»
radiation for optical pyrometry was removed.

Inasmuch as the numerical values of temperature on the IPTS-48
were the same as on the ITS-48, the former was not a revision of the
scale of 1948 but merely an amended form of it.


=== The International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68)

In 1968 the Comité International des Poids et Mesures promulgated
the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968, having been
empowered to do so by the thirteenth Conférence Générale of 1967-1968.
The IPTS-68 incorporated very extensive changes from the IPTS-48.
These included numerical changes, designed to bring it more nearly
in accord with thermodynamic temperatures, that were sufficiently large
to be apparent to many users. Other changes were as follows: the
Jower limit of the scale was extended down to stem:[13.81 " "rm(K)]; at even lower
temperatures (stem:[0.5 " "rm(K)] to stem:[5.2 " "rm(K)]), the use of two helium vapour pressure
scales was recommended; six new defining fixed points were introduced
-- the triple point of equilibrium hydrogen (stem:[13.81 " "rm(K)]), an intermediate
equilibrium hydrogen point (stem:[17.042 " "rm(K)]), the normal boiling point of
equilibrium hydrogen (stem:[20.28 " "rm(K)]), the boiling point of neon (stem:[27.102 " "rm(K)]),
the triple point of oxygen (stem:[54.361 " "rm(K)]), and the freezing point of tin
(stem:[231.9681 " "rm(°C)]) which became a permitted altcrnative to the boiling point
of water; the boiling point of sulphur was deleted; the values assigned
to four fixed points were changed -- the boiling point of oxygen
(stem:[90.188 " "rm(K)]), the freezing point of zinc (stem:[419.58 " "rm(°C)]), the freezing point of
silver (stem:[961.93 " "rm(°C)]), and the freezing point of gold (stem:[1064.43 " "rm(°C)]); the
interpolating formulae for the resistance thermometer range became
much more complex; the value assigned to the second radiation
constant c, became stem:[1.4388 xx 10^{-7}" "rm(m) * rm(K)]; the permitted ranges of the
constants for the interpolation formulae for the resistance thermometer
and thermocouple were again modified.


=== The International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (Amended Edition of 1975) (IPTS-68)

The International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968, amended
edition of 1975, was adopted by the fifteenth Conférence Générale in
1975. As was the case for the IPTS-48 with respect to the ITS-48, the
IPTS-68 (75) introduced no numerical changes. Most of the extensive
textual changes were intended only to clarify and simplify its use. More
substantive changes were: the oxygen point was defined as the
condensation point rather than the boiling point; the triple point of
argon (stem:[83.798 " "rm(K)]) was introduced as a permitted alternative to the
condensation point of oxygen; new values of the isotopic composition
of naturally occurring neon were adopted; the recommendation to use
values of stem:[ii(T)] given by the 1958 ^3^He and 1962 ^3^He vapour-pressure scales
was rescinded.


=== The 1976 Provisional stem:[0.5 " "rm(K)] to stem:[30 " "rm(K)] Temperature Scale (EPT-76)

The 1976 Provisional stem:[0.5 " "rm(K)] to stem:[30 " "rm(K)] Temperature Scale was introduced
to meet two important requirements: these were to provide means of
substantially reducing the errors (with respect to corresponding thermodynamic values)
below stem:[27 " "rm(K)] that were then known to exist in the
IPTS-68 and throughout the temperature ranges of the ^4^He and ^3^He
vapour pressure scales of 1958 and 1962 respectively, and to bridge the
gap between stem:[5.2 " "rm(K)] and stem:[13.81 " "rm(K)] in which there had not previously been
an international scale. Other objectives in devising the EPT-76 were
«&nbsp;that it should be thermodynamically smooth, that it should be
continuous with the IPTS-68 at stem:[27.1 " "rm(K)], and that is should agree with
thermodynamic temperature stem:[ii(T)] as closely as these two conditions allow&nbsp;».
In contrast with the IPTS-68, and to ensure its rapid adoption, several
methods of realizing the EPT-76 were approved. These included: using
a thermodynamic interpolation instrument and one or more of eleven
assigned reference points; taking differences from the IPTS-68 above
stem:[13.81 " "rm(K)]; taking differences from helium vapour pressure scales below
stem:[5 " "rm(K)]; and taking differences from certain well-established laboratory
scales. Because there was a certain «&nbsp;lack of internal consistency&nbsp;» it
was admitted that «&nbsp;slight ambiguities between realizations&nbsp;» might be
introduced. However the advantages gained by adopting the EPT-76 as
a working scale until such time as the IPTS-68 should be revised and
extended were considered to outweigh the disadvantages.
