== Purpose

This document describes the process employed by the Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) for soliciting, receiving and reviewing for completeness the nominations of reference measurement services provided by calibration (reference) laboratories for evaluation by the JCTLM Database working group...


== Scope

This procedure will be applied to the documents submitted from all Reference Measurement Laboratories (RMLs) and National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) who nominate services for listing in the JCTLM database.


== Acronyms and definitions

All acronyms and definitions employed in the procedures of the JCTLM DB WG Quality Manual are given in the procedure document JCTLM EXE-G01, Glossary of terms and definitions.

Submitting nomination forms for consideration by the DB WG:


==== {blank}

The JCTLM Secretariat preliminary reviews submitted nominations for completeness within six weeks of their receipt in consultation with the DB WG Chair and vice-chair(s).

Distributing Nominations from National Metrology Institutes.

The JCTLM Secretariat, after consulting the DB WG Chair and vice-chair(s), distributes nominations from National Metrology Institutes, which should include information on published CMC claims in the BIPM Key comparison database, to the team leaders of the Review Teams with the appropriate expertise to perform the review according to procedure P-03-B1.

Distributing Nominations from Accredited Laboratories to Review Teams.

The JCTLM Secretariat, after consulting the DB WG Chair and vice-chair(s), distributes nominations to the team leaders of the Review Teams with the appropriate expertise to perform the review according to different procedures according to the status of accreditation.

For laboratories that are accredited according to ISO 15195 and ISO/IEC 17025 as calibration laboratories nomination is submitted to the review team for application of procedure P-03-B2.


=== {blank}

Any Review Team member affiliated to a nominating organization will not participate in the evaluation of reference measurement laboratory services *from that organization*. See JCTLM DB WG-P-06 *for dealing with a potential or perceived conflicts of interest*.


=== {blank}

The distributed nominations from Reference Measurement Service providers are reviewed by the Review Teams according to:

* JCTLM DB WG P-03-B1 "`Process for Verification and Publication of Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC) Claims in the JCTLM Database (National Metrology Institutes)`", or

* JCTLM WG P-03-B2 "`Process for Review of Reference Measurement Services from Laboratories who are accredited as Calibration Laboratories (ISO/IEC 17025/ 15195)`".


=== {blank}

The results of the review are recorded in JCTLM DB WG P-03B-F-02 by the RT leader and returned to the JCTLM Secretariat by 31^st^ October.

=== {blank}

The secretariat compiles all review forms and recommendations and forwards these to the DB WG vice-Chair(s) for verification. Queries raised by the vice-Chair(s) are returned to the Review Team Leader and the JCTLM Secretariat. Answers to queries and the review teams’ recommendations and review forms are returned to the JCTLM Secretariat.

==== {blank}

The DB WG reviews at its annual meeting the recommendations from the review teams prior formal approval by the JCTLM Executive. (See DB WG P-05)


==== {blank}

The review forms are forwarded to the nominator at the end of the review cycle following approval of the recommendation by the JCTLM Executive Committee. (EXE-P-05)


=== {blank}

Reference measurement services listed on the JCTLM website will be re-reviewed every three years, and this process was first implemented in December 2013.

The laboratory having a reference measurement service listed in the database must provide evidence that its status for accreditation for compliance with ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 15195 is up-to-date, and that its participation in appropriate EQAS Scheme for Reference Laboratory fulfill the two following JCTLM requirements;

. The laboratory must participate every year for at least one measurand in a group of analyte for which a service is listed, and,
. The laboratory must participate for each listed measurand at least once in a time period of three years.

The RELA advisor will review the participation of the laboratories having reference measurement services listed in the JCTLM Database with respect to the above cited criteria and report on the status of the laboratories’ RELA participation to the JCTLM Executive.


=== {blank}

Any appeal against recommendations of the JCTLM DB WG will be submitted to the Secretariat and finally decided by the JCTLM Executive after consulting the DB WG Chair, vice-chair(s). The appealing process is described in the procedure document DBWG-P-09.
