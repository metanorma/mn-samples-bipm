== Purpose

This document describes the process employed by the Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) for soliciting, receiving and verifying the completeness of the nominations of certified reference materials (CRMs) and reference measurement methods/procedures (RMM/Ps) to be listed as being of a higher metrological order.


== Scope

This procedure applies to all nominations of certified reference materials and reference measurement methods/procedures for classification as being of a higher metrological order by the JCTLM DB WG review teams according to the criteria given in the normative ISO standards.


== Acronyms and definitions

All acronyms and definitions employed in the procedures of the JCTLM DB WG Quality Manual are given in the procedure document JCTLM EXE-G01, Glossary of terms and definitions.


== Responsibilities and Authorizations

== Procedure

=== {blank}

The process for nominating and reviewing materials and methods/procedures of a higher metrological order for recommendation by the JCTLM for listing in the database will occur annually.

=== {blank}

Nominations are solicited exclusively from producers of CRMs and developer/owners of RMM/Ps
The Secretariat announces an open solicitation for nominations of CRMs and RMM/Ps for inclusion in the JCTLM database of available materials and methods/procedures of a higher metrological order. The solicitation is made each year from February to the end of May. The solicitation announcement is found on the website of the BIPM at : https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/jc/jctlm/jctlm-nominations-and-review.html

==== {blank}

A fixed date for receiving completed nominations will be specified in the announcement. Nominations received after the date specified in the solicitation announcement may be deferred for review in a subsequent review cycle.

===== {blank}

The deadline for submitting nominations is 30^th^ May. In the case of reference method nominations, the submission deadline remains 30^th^ May, but it is possible to submit the final version (non-changeable format) of its supporting documentation or publication by the 30^th^ September.

=== {blank}

Obtaining Nomination Forms:
Providers of CRMs and developer/owners of RMM/Ps can obtain nomination forms from download on the BIPM website:

Reference Material Nomination Form available at: +
https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/JCTLM/DBWG-P-02A-F-01.xls

Reference Method/Procedure Nomination Form available at: +
https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/JCTLM/DBWG-P-02A-F-02.xls


=== {blank}

Submitting Nomination Forms for consideration by the DB WG:

==== {blank}

Nominating forms must be submitted by email to the JCTLM Secretariat at jctlm@bipm.org. Additional information and instructions for completing the forms are found on the BIPM website at https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/JCTLM/DBWG-P-02A-I-01.pdf

==== {blank}

Only nominations submitted from producers of CRMs or developer/owners of RMM/Ps will be accepted for review by the review teams.

==== {blank}

Producers of reference materials and developer/owners of RMM/Ps acknowledge that a submitted nomination constitutes consent to include the material or method/procedure on the JCTLM List I of CRMs and RMM/Ps, or JCTLM List II of CRMs, or JCTLM List III of CRMs.

===== {blank}

Distinctions between List I, List II, and List III materials are given in the Preamble to the JCTLM DB WG Quality Manual.

===== {blank}

JCTLM DB WG will recommend on which list nominated CRMs are to be included.

==== {blank}

Only materials for which the requisite information required by ISO 15194 for evaluation is publicly available can be candidates for listing.

==== {blank}

Materials can be listed only if the producer consents to comparison studies with the same measurand(s) in other materials already listed or that are nominated.

===== {blank}

When submitting a nomination of a CRM, the producer must identify if currently listed CRMs are intended for the same purpose, and subsequently carry out a comparison study for comparing certified values of the same measurand in multiple Reference Materials. See document DBWG P-04A which describes methods to ascertain comparability of CRM values.

==== {blank}

By submitting a nomination of a CRM the producer acknowledges that the results of comparison studies with other listed CRMs for the same measurand(s) will be publicly available for review on the JCTLM website and consents to this requirement.

==== {blank}

Only methods for which the requisite information for performing the RMM/P is publicly available can be considered for listing.

==== {blank}

Methods can be listed only if the developer consents to comparison studies with other methods already listed or nominated for inclusion in JCTLM lists that are fit for the same purpose. See procedure DBWG-P-04B.

===== {blank}

When submitting a nomination of a RMM/P, the developer must identify if currently listed RMM/Ps are intended for the same purpose, and subsequently carry out a comparison study of methods for the same measurand when appropriate.

===== {blank}

If subsequently obtained comparison results indicate that variability greater than expected from the combined uncertainties of compared methods exists, the developers of the concerned methods shall be informed and are required to investigate and resolve the differences. The need for corrective actions shall be reported and may result in temporary delisting until the discrepancies are resolved, and the developer consents to this requirement.

==== {blank}

By submitting a nomination for a RMM/P the developer acknowledges that the results of comparison studies with other listed RMM/Ps that are fit for the same purpose will be publicly available for review on the JCTLM website and consents to this requirement.

==== {blank}

When submitting a nomination for a RMM/P for a measurand not yet covered by JCTLM the developer shall state the expected impact of the method within a calibration hierarchy on available routine laboratory measurement results.

==== {blank}

Nominations for CRMs or RMM/Ps are to be made by completing in full the following forms.

===== {blank}

Materials nomination spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) form (DBWG-P-02A-F-01 Reference Material Nomination Form) is referenced to ISO 15194.

====== {blank}

A Compliance demonstration spreadsheet included in the reference material nomination form being submitted, must be completed by the nominating organization to describe how compliance is met for all requirements listed in ISO 15194:2009(E).

===== {blank}

Reference method/procedure nomination spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) form (DBWG-P-02A-F-02 Reference Measurement Method/Procedure Nomination Form) is referenced to ISO 15193.

====== {blank}

A Compliance demonstration spreadsheet included in the reference method/procedure nomination form being submitted, must be completed by the nominating organization to describe how compliance is met for all requirements listed in ISO 15193:2009(E).

==== {blank}

Submission is to be made to the JCTLM Secretariat as an attachment to an email message to jctlm@bipm.org

=== {blank}

The Secretariat reviews nominations for completeness within one month of their receipt.

==== {blank}

The preliminary review is only concerned with completeness and is NOT a review of the qualification of the nominated material or method/procedure.

==== {blank}

Incomplete forms will be returned to the individual making the nomination.

==== {blank}

Returned nomination forms that are incomplete may be amended and resubmitted once during a review cycle.

==== {blank}

Resubmissions must be received by the date specified on the solicitation.

==== {blank}

Nominations or resubmissions which are incomplete will not be reviewed in the current cycle.

==== {blank}

Nominations or resubmissions which are received after the date specified may be held until the next review cycle.

=== {blank}

Distributing Nominations to the DB WG review teams

==== {blank}

The Secretariat distributes in consultation with the DB WG vice-chair(s) the nominations to the team leaders of the appropriate review teams to perform the review.

==== {blank}

Any DB WG review team member affiliated with a nominating organization will not participate in the evaluation of a material or method/procedure *from that organization*. See JCTLM DB WG-P-06 *for dealing with potential or perceived conflicts of interest*.

===== {blank}

Should a lack of experts make this restriction unenforceable, an exception can be made only with prior consent of the JCTLM Executive.

=== {blank}

The distributed nominations are reviewed by the DB WG review teams according to JCTLM DBWG-P-03A.
