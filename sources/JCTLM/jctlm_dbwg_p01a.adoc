== Purpose

This outline provides an overview of the process by which the JCTLM Database working group (DB WG) and its review teams make recommendations for listing reference materials


== Scope

The processes outlined in this document apply to all Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) and Reference Measurement Methods/Procedures (RMM/Ps) nominated for inclusion by the JCTLM in its lists of available higher-order materials and procedures.


== Acronyms and definitions

All acronyms and definitions employed in the procedures of the JCTLM DB WG Quality Manual are given in the procedure document JCTLM EXE-G01, Glossary of terms and definitions.


== Procedures

The procedure for the evaluation of materials and procedures to be listed by the JCTLM as being of a higher metrological order is segmented into three processes. The details of each process are presented in the individual procedures of the JCTLM DB WG Quality Manual. The attached flowchart indicates how the detailed processes are interconnected.
The procedure by which the JCTLM DB WG communicates and is managed is indicated in this attached flowchart.
